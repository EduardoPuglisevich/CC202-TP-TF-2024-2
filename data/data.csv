Assignments that tap into trainee creativity are increasingly used both to prepare learners for the demands of clinical work and to understand the personal and professional challenges learners face in these contexts. Health professions educators need methods for interpreting these creations in order to understand each learner's expressions. This paper describes two theoretical frameworks that can be used to understand trainees’ unique learning experiences as they are expressed in arts- and humanities-based creations. Methods: The authors introduce the philosophical underpinnings and interpretation procedures of two theoretical frameworks that enable educators to ‘hear’ and ‘see’ the multilayered expressions embedded within arts- and humanities-based student creations: Gilligan's Listening Guide and Kress and van Leeuwen's approach to visual rhetoric. To illustrate how these frameworks can be used, the authors apply them to two creative summaries that learners made as part of a humanities-informed, interprofessional education intervention that took place in a non-acute-care teaching hospital. The interpretations of two creative summaries, a poem and a pair of paintings, highlight how applying these theoretical frameworks can offer important insights into learners’ experiences. Conclusions: This cross-cutting edge paper describes how the Listening Guide and visual rhetoric can help health professions educators listen to and read the arts- and humanities-based creative expressions made by learners. Insights gained from these interpretations can advance the understanding of students’ personal experiences in different learning environments and can inform curriculum development. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical Education","Art; Clinical Competence; Communication; Comprehension; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humanities; Humans; Learning; Poetry as Topic; conceptual framework; curriculum development; human; human experiment; learning environment; occupation; painting; personal experience; student; teaching hospital; art; clinical competence; comprehension; curriculum; education; humanities; interpersonal communication; learning; literature; medical education; procedures; standards",Arts and Humanities

The various APIs (Application programming interfaces) and mashups that are employed in these traditionally ""qualitative"" disciplines offer tools for creative and often critical interpretations. Data are becoming means of a critical distance to the visual and media saturated world that bring whole new perspective on our everyday life and reality. These emerging critical and visual practices define a realism based on data rather than on human perception, reason or some strong ontological theses. This data oriented realism does not simply represent reality but performs the modern processes of its construction with an almost iconoclastic fervor. It offers a distance from the power and seduction of the (digital) image and asks questions about their conditions of possibility, methods of gathering and the various possibilities of their representation. Visualization of various data in the form of popular user generated mashups, serious art visualizations and new digital methods in humanities create a tension between the new forms of iconoclastic realism and the more playful dada collage techniques that are satirical and rather than realist and emancipatory rather than iconoclastic. The use of visualizations in art, humanities and online popular culture (cyberculture) is defined by this tension between data realism to dada ""aggregations"". © 2010 IEEE.",Application programming interfaces (API); Visualization; API; Art; Collage; Critical distance; Dada; Data; Mash-up; Realis; Data visualization,Arts and Humanities

Research shows that such topics are necessary for the development of critical thinking, this type of analysis being innate to these domains. In this paper, I introduce the concept of creating meaning, which I define as the link between creative thinking and critical thinking and as the first attribute of a critical thinker. Before making inferences, judgements or decisions, one must identify the framework of a problem, determine the parameters of the discussion and reflect upon assumptions. These are propaedeutic to a good discussion and are prerequisites of a good critical thinker. Arguing that creativity is not a separate process from critical thinking, I aim to demonstrate that the Arts, Humanities and Cultural Studies are the promoters of critical thinking. Because disciplines in these fields are likely to create environments that foster critical thinking and encourage the production of meaning, I argue that these necessarily belong in all curricula of Higher Education. © 2019, © 2019 Society for Research into Higher Education.",,Arts and Humanities

Each side provides strong arguments, but there has been little empirical research to draw on. A key reason for the lack of scientific evidence is the absence of a conceptual model on which to base investigations of the ways the arts and the humanities might contribute to human flourishing. To address this, we present a model to demarcate the domain of the arts and humanities by means of an extensional definition (e.g. majors, disciplines, and occupations) integrated with a functional analysis (i.e. modes of engagement and activities of involvement). We suggest immersion, embeddedness, socialisation, and reflectiveness as mechanisms by which the arts and humanities may enhance various forms of human flourishing.

Research on passion for the arts and humanities demonstrates that the type of passion matters: while engaging in the arts and humanities out of harmonious passion leads to adaptive outcomes and even protects against negative ones, being obsessively passionate may be maladaptive.

Design/methodology/approach - Data covering the period 2002-2007 were collected from the SSCI and AHCI of the Web of Science, an online service of Thomson Scientific in June 2008. Findings - SSCI and AHCI indexed a total of 716 publications on Nigeria, 634 and 82 respectively. Paper production in each of these fields rose during 2002 to 2004 and 2005 respectively, and then started dropping. The publications received a total of 1,371 citations; the 82 AHCI documents received only six citations, while the 634 SSCI publications received 1,366 citations, equivalent to means of 0.06 and 2.15 citations per AHCI and SSCI document respectively. Only 6.1 per cent of the AHCI documents were cited compared with 46.7 per cent of SSCI publications; but citation of social science papers was consistently on the increase, while citation of arts and humanities publications, flattened in 200 humanities, was consistently on the increase. In both fields, article type of papers written in English dominated. Research limitations/implications - This research covers only a period of six years; a fuller picture would be obtained with a longer period.

Despite widespread efforts within and beyond the field to document how arts and humanities research creates social value, these arguments have had little traction within public policy debates. The paper argues that other disciplines have been able to mobilise an 'investment logic', based on a more nuanced model of how knowledge creates value, showing how investing in small research projects drives economic growth, highlighting, for instance, the direct links between universities, spin-offs, the biotech sector and large pharmaceutical firms. If one looks at arts and humanities research through this lens, it is possible to find examples of how individual pieces of arts and humanities research are translated upwards through first-order users, through networks, to create societal improvements: it is therefore possible to meaningfully argue for arts and humanities research driving societal value creation. The paper concludes by reflecting on how arts and humanities research might apply this wider model of research valorisation to better convey its societal benefits in contemporary science policy discussions. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",,Arts and Humanities

This narrative systematic review synthesises 42 peer-reviewed arts and humanities articles published between 2007-2016, indexed in four international databases. The results indicate that the majority of research has been undertaken in language learning, predominantly in East Asian countries, with limited grounding of research in theory. This review found that educational technology supports student engagement, with behavioural engagement by far the most prevalent dimension. Affective engagement was the lowest observed dimension, with affective disengagement the most prevalent negative dimension. Blogs, mobile learning, and assessment tools were the most effective at promoting engagement. However, caution and education in how to use technology are needed, as any use not underpinned by effective and informed pedagogy can also lead to students feeling overwhelmed and disengaging from learning. Further research is needed on online collaboration, as well as international courses that offer cross-cultural opportunities for language use, and the increased use of qualitative methods is also advised. Implications for practice or policy: • Empirical research on student engagement must include a definition and be aligned to theory. • Research must include full contextual details. • Students need to understand the reasons behind using educational technology, be taught how to use the tools involved, and be encouraged to engage with peers and teachers through blogs, ePortfolios and collaborative tools. • Using blogs and discussion forums can help students to model language and thereby reduce anxiety. © 2020, Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE).",,Arts and Humanities

While activities primarily focus on ecological research, arts and humanities inquiry emerged in 2002 and since then, a substantial body of creative work has been produced at LTER-affiliated sites. These art-humanities-science collaborations parallel a wider trend in universities and non-profits. However, there is little empirical work on the value and effectiveness of this work. After launching a survey in 2013 to assess the values and challenges associated with arts and humanities in the LTER Network (Goralnik et al. 2015), which identified empathy as a meaningful potential outcome of this creative work, we conducted a follow-up analysis to understand the following: the relevance of empathy in the LTER Network; the role of empathy in bridging arts, humanities, and science collaborations; and the capacity of empathy to connect wider audiences both to LTER science and to the natural world. Our research included phone interviews with representatives from 15 LTER sites and an audience perception survey at an LTER-hosted art show. We found that arts-humanities-science collaborations have great potential to catalyze relationships between scholars, the public, and the natural world; cultivate inspiration and empathy for the natural world; and spark awareness shifts that can enable pro-environmental behavior. Our research demonstrates the potential for art-humanities-science collaborations to facilitate conservation attitudes and action in the Network and beyond. © 2016, AESS.",attitudinal survey; empirical analysis; environmental economics; humanitarian aid; interdisciplinary approach; perception; public attitude; university sector,Arts and Humanities

Methods: Authors searched Medline ALL (Ovid), Embase.com, Web of Science, and Academic Search Ultimate to identify articles on evaluated arts and humanities programs in surgery education. The search identified 1,282 titles and abstracts, of which 55 underwent independent full-text review. The authors identified 10 articles that met inclusion criteria, from which they collected and analysed data. Results: Medical students were the identified learners in most studies (6/10; 60%). Reflective writing was the arts and humanities activity in half of the studies (5/10; 50%); activities based on film, visual art other than film, literature, or social media in the remaining studies (5/10; 50%). Most studies (8/10; 80%) featured a non-controlled, non-randomized design. Authors categorised 5 studies (50%) as Kirkpatrick Level 1, 4 (40%) as Level 2, and 1 (10%) as Level 3. Conclusion: Integration of the arts and humanities into surgery education may promote increased levels of learner reflection and empathy, in addition to improved acquisition of surgical skills. More rigorous evaluation of these programs would clarify the impact of arts and humanities programs on surgery learners. © 2023 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.","Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Empathy; Humanities; Humans; Students, Medical; article; education; Embase; empathy; human; human experiment; humanities; medical education; medical student; Medline; performing arts; skill; social media; systematic review; Web of Science; writing; curriculum; education; humanities; medical student",Arts and Humanities

Results show that different from SCIE/SSCI, both the annual publication volumes in the A&HCI database and all A&HCI journals have remained relatively stagnant in all document types considered scenario or have gained relatively slight increases in only citable items considered scenario. Although the number of A&HCI journals also has increased remarkably, the average journal publication volume of A&HCI journals has decreased gradually if all document types are considered or kept relatively stagnant when citable items only are considered. Besides, the A&HCI database has ceased the systematic index of individually selected items from SCIE/SSCI journals since 2018.

The authors examine three projects linking social work, the arts, and humanities [Arts in Recovery (AIR), the Leaving Homelessness Intervention Research Project (LHIRP), and Interdisciplinary Research on Environmental Design (IRED)] for the lessons they offer social work education. They pay particular attention to the art exhibit and its catalog as products that educate the public on various social issues, as well as the exhibit visitation experience that parallels key components of traditional group work and community development. Implications for social work include teaching interdisciplinary collaboration, integrating the arts into social work methods, emphasizing the importance of participatory action research, and creating settings that promote community engagement. The authors then draw implications for how the arts and humanities can influence or otherwise shape the paradigm of social work education and instruction in the areas of policy, human behavior, practice methods, and research. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,Arts and Humanities

Ninety-one publications were indexed in Scopus and WOS databases between 2018 and 2022. All publications appeared in 69 different journals, books, and conferences. About 51.6% of all studies were single-authored. The median number of publications per author was 27.01 ± 48.0 and that of citations was 223.0 ± 764.0. Positive correlations were observed between the journal’s CiteScore and authors’ count with citation number (r2 =.625 and.207 respectively; p <.005). Publications written by ≥3 authors with international collaboration received the maximum number of citations (p <.005). Moreover, the mean number of citations for publications written by associate or assistant professors was significantly higher than those composed by their peers (p =.033). Defining the field of arts and humanities remains a difficult exercise, because of its blurry theoretical background.

These hubs fund collaborative ‘knowledge exchange’ (KE) projects between creative businesses and academics in the arts and humanities. The paper first outlines the unclear relationship between knowledge exchange activities in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and the creative economy. The second step unpacks the approaches to KE that the hubs are developing. The third step considers what the consequences of such projects might be. The paper concludes that such ‘third mission’ activities are never neutral or apolitical spaces.

Arts and humanities content could promote the personal and professional qualities we desire in clinicians including competence, compassion, and empathy. The aim of this research was to determine what PA students report learning from A&H modules designed to foster personal insight and perspective-taking. Methods The ""Introduction of Humanities & Arts into Physician Assistant Education""(IHAPAE) project is an intercampus collaboration between 2 Midwest Universities. The IHAPAE faculty collaboratively created and delivered A&H-based modules within first-year communication courses. Two cohorts of PA students (N = 130) participated in modules and subsequently attended exploratory focus groups to elicit their perceptions of the A&H curriculum. Results Using a constructivist grounded theory approach for data analysis, we found that PA students perceived multiple benefits. Specifically, module content promoted reflection and stress reduction, improved their continuity of care notes, provided utility in cultivating empathy in patient communication, and introduced students to A&H approaches they could recommend to patients. Discussion The process model that emerged from student perceptions fits well with existing emotional regulation theory and provides empirical evidence for cultivation of empathy and patient-centeredness. Given the positive outcomes of our project, PA programs should consider the value of incorporating the A&H activities into their curriculum to enhance the student experience and develop essential provider attributes and skills.

Despite this, there is still a need for methodological tools to investigate the psychological mechanisms through which engagement in arts and humanities enhances individual well-being. Using four rounds of data collection (including one retest), we document the development and validation of the scales measuring each of the five theorized mechanisms: reflection, acquisition, immersion, socialization, and expression. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, we found a three-factor structure for reflection (life/worldview, emotional, and external), and six-factor for acquisition (vicarious experience, direct encouragement, social persuasion, experience of mastery—ability, experience of mastery—success, and positive physiological response), two-factor structure for immersion (effort and passage of time), three-factor for socialization (relationships, identity, conversation), and one-factor structure for expression.

This multidisciplinary project brings together the arts and humanities with the social sciences with their different epistemological philosophies and subsequent understandings of research methods. The main objective was to determine how visual arts activities may change, sustain and catalyse community cultures, beliefs, attitudes and behaviours to create dementia-friendly communities. This project involves 6 different UK universities, 14 researchers, 10 formal partners, 7 project artists, 3 research artists and a large number of civil society organisations. The analysis presents a series of themes that have been identified as influencing the approach taken to develop methods which aimed to speak to different audiences in the social sciences, arts and humanities, policy/practice and public domains. It is concluded that a research project of this type needs to embrace a wide variety of epistemological positions if it is to successfully achieve its objectives.

Like all medical curricula, those integrating the A&H are more likely to achieve the desired outcomes when the learning domains, goals, objectives, activities, and evaluation strategies are well-aligned. Few faculty development programs focus on helping medical educators design A&H curricula in a scholarly manner. The Prism Model, an evidence-based tool, supports educators developing A&H medical curricula in a rigorous way for maximum impact. The model posits that the A&H can serve four pedagogical functions for medical learners: 1) skill mastery, 2) perspective taking, 3) personal insight, and 4) social advocacy. Although this model has been described in the literature, no practical guidance exists for medical educators seeking to apply it to the development of a specific curriculum. This paper provides a step-by-step demonstration of how to use the Prism Model to design an A&H curriculum. Beginning with the first step of selecting a learning domain through the final step of curriculum evaluation, this paper helps medical educators apply the Prism Model to develop A&H curricula with intentionality and rigour to achieve the desired learning outcomes. © 2023 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.","Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Humanities; Humans; controlled study; curriculum development; evidence based practice; human; human experiment; humanities; learning; medical education; Note; pedagogics; skill; university; clinical competence; curriculum; education",Arts and Humanities

Goldsmiths is a UK research-intensive higher education institution which specialises in arts, humanities and social science research. The paper's aim is to raise awareness of the subject-specific needs of AHSS scholars to help inform the design of future digital tools for impact analysis in AHSS. Firstly, I shall explore the definition of research data and how it is currently understood by AHSS researchers. I will show why many researchers choose not to engage with digital dissemination techniques and ORCID. This discussion must necessarily include the idea that practice-based and applied AHSS research are processes which are not easily captured in numerical 'sets' and cannot be labelled electronically without giving careful consideration to what a group or data item 'represents' as part of the academic enquiry, and therefore how it should be cited and analysed as part of any impact assessment. Then, the paper will explore: the role of the monograph and arts catalogue in AHSS scholarship; how citation practices and digital impact measurement in AHSS currently operate in relation to authorship and how digital identifiers may hypothetically impact on metrics, intellectual property (IP), copyright and research integrity issues in AHSS. I will also show that, if we are to be truly interdisciplinary, as research funders and strategic thinkers say we should, it is necessary to revise the way we think about digital research dissemination. This will involve breaking down the boundaries between AHSS and other types of research. © 2015 Swijghuisen Reigersberg M.",access to information; Article; arts humanities and social science research; awareness; book; digital object identifier; information dissemination; information processing; interdisciplinary research; patent; publishing; research; research ethics; scientific literature; sociology,Arts and Humanities

The first half of this chapter introduces the work of the Humanities and Human Flourishing Project (HHF), a growing international and multidisciplinary network of scholars, researchers, and creators that the editors of this volume have led since 2014 with the aim of establishing the Positive Humanities as a robust field. Among other endeavors, HHF has conducted literature reviews, developed and refined a conceptual model, created and validated a toolkit of measures, and identified five key psychological mechanisms connecting the arts and humanities to human flourishing: reflection, acquisition, immersion, socialization, and expression (RAISE). The second half of this chapter introduces the six parts of this Handbook: overview of the Positive Humanities, historical and current trends, flourishing outcomes, pathways from arts and humanities engagement to human flourishing, disciplinary considerations, and public engagement and policy. The aim of the various parts of this Handbook is to bring together theoretical, empirical, and applied work to advance the understanding of the range of effects that engagement in the arts and humanities can have on human flourishing.

The Association of American Medical Colleges changed the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) in 2015 to place new emphasis on the role of liberal arts in the process of developing well-rounded physicians. Consequently, medical schools have been implementing more connections to creative writing, literature, theater, movies, music, and the visual arts into their curricula. To review the current literature, we focused on methods medical educators used to embed content related to AH into their curricula to shape and drive associated learning outcomes. We conducted searches in PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ERIC for peer-reviewed articles from 2011 to 2020. The authors selected three dyads in medical humanities and reviewed articles independently followed by discussion to identify thematic links to major findings. Out of 261 articles, a total of 177 full-text articles were reviewed with 34 selected for final inclusion. Our review included articles describing curriculum development and delivery in publications from Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, and the USA. This review showed medical educators are implementing didactic and experiential instructional approaches to embedding the arts, humanities, and social sciences into the medical school classroom. Medical educators’ attempts to embed AH into medical school curricula show promising results. Unfortunately, small sample sizes, short-term interventions, and an over-reliance of subjective assessment measures limit our knowledge of the true impact of these interventions. More rigorous assessments of required and longitudinal coursework are necessary to know the true impact of participation in AH coursework for medical students. © 2021, American Association for Cancer Education.","Curriculum; Education, Medical; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humanities; Humans; Learning; Students, Medical; Australia; Canada; Cinahl; curriculum development; embedding; empathy; human; human experiment; India; learning; medical humanities; medical school; medical student; Medline; narrative; New Zealand; PsycINFO; review; sample size; sociology; systematic review; curriculum; education; humanities; learning; medical education; medical student; procedures",Arts and Humanities

In this study, we explore medical students' reflections following an arts and humanities experience. An intensive day and a half long program focused on music and reflection was designed for first-year students at Harvard Medical School. Methods: Students completed an evaluation of the experience with both open-ended and Likert scale questions. Data were analyzed using a mixed methods approach. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze quantitative data and inductive content analysis for qualitative data. Results: 168 first-year medical and dental students participated in the activity. Survey response rate was 73% (n = 122). Quantitatively, the overall quality of the experience was assessed at a mean value of 4.86 points (SD = 0.37 points) out of a maximum of 5, with 5 being excellent. The qualitative evaluation illustrated how the arts and humanities experience encouraged students to reflect on their leadership and doctoring skills, taking a holistic approach to their medical education, and integrating the lessons of the arts and humanities into their medical practice. Conclusion: The arts and humanities program encouraged student reflection on profound questions in medicine related to empathy, vulnerability, and authenticity. This experience broadened students’ perspectives regarding the relationship between medicine and the arts and humanities. © 2023 Association of Medical Education in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (AMEEMR)",article; content analysis; controlled study; dental student; empathy; human; human experiment; leadership; learning; Likert scale; major clinical study; medical education; medical practice; medical school; medical student; music; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; skill; vulnerability,Arts and Humanities

However, enduring controversies regarding the purpose, efficacy, and implementation of humanities initiatives suggest that the timing and context of trainees’ exposure to such content is a key, but seldom considered, factor. To better understand the affordances of introducing humanities-based health curriculum prior to the HPE admissions gateway, we conducted a qualitative instrumental case study with participants from Canada’s first Health Humanities baccalaureate program. Fully anonymized transcripts from semi-structured interviews (n = 11) and focus groups (n = 14) underwent an open-coding procedure for thematic narrative analysis to reveal three major temporal domains of described experience (i.e., prior to, during, and following their participation in a 12-week semester-long “Introduction to Health Humanities” course). Our findings demonstrate that perceptions of arts- and humanities content in health education are generated well in advance of HPE admission. Among other findings, we define a new concept—epistemological multicompetence—to describe participants’ emergent capability to toggle between (and advocate for the role of) multiple disciplines, arts and humanities particularly, in health-related teaching and learning at the pre-professional level. Improved coordination of baccalaureate and HPE curricula may therefore enhance the development of capabilities associated with arts and humanities, including: epistemological multicompetence, aesthetic sensibility, and other sought-after qualities in HPE candidates. In conclusion, attending to the pre-professional admissions gateway presents a new, capabilities-driven approach to enhancing both the implementation and critical understanding of arts and humanities’ purpose, role, and effects across the “life course” of health professions education. © 2020, The Author(s).",Canada; Curriculum; Female; Health Occupations; Humanities; Humans; Interdisciplinary Studies; Interviews as Topic; Male; Qualitative Research; Time Factors; Young Adult; adult; article; Canada; clinical article; curriculum; empathy; female; genetic transcription; human; human experiment; learning; male; medical education; medical humanities; narrative; occupation; perception; semi structured interview; sensibility; curriculum; education; humanities; interdisciplinary education; interview; medical profession; qualitative research; time factor; young adult,Arts and Humanities

A Network of Expert Centres has been recently been established with a broad mission to facilitate exchange of expertise and outreach across the community of practice engaged in all aspects of digital arts and humanities research and scholarship, including practice-led research; and to promote and facilitate engagement with digital methodologies within the broader research community. Areas of interest and expertise of members include data creation, curation, preservation, management (including rights and legal issues), access and dissemination, and methodologies of data use and re-use. Its membership is open to all such Centres in Great Britain and Ireland. Since the demise of the Arts and Humanities Data Service and the AHRC ICT Methods Network, there has been no centralized supporting infrastructure and co-oordination of activity in this area. While the Network is by no means a substitute for these services, it will provide a much-needed focus and community resource for all aspects of the digital arts and humanities, including digital tools, projects and methods, as well as data management and sustainability. The Network will also provide greater visibility for publicly funded research projects in this area. The Network’s mission is to advocate, promote and raise awareness and understanding of the use of ICT in research and scholarship in arts and humanities. It will take an active role in developing the scholarly communication agenda in relation to all aspects of digital publications, and outputs. Publications and outputs developed by members will be disseminated via the community resource, arts-humanities.net, which will support the development and exchange of expertise, knowledge, standards and good practice. The Network will also identify and represent the needs of the research community in this key strategic area, and conduct dialogue with relevant stakeholders including funders, libraries, and those engaged in teaching and research in related disciplines. This article sets out the background to the establishment of the Network, its structure and plans for future development. © Edinburgh University Press and the Association for History and Computing 2010.",,Arts and Humanities

In today's world, with globalization and rapid changes, a cultural approach is crucial for uncovering and comprehending the diversity of cultures, their interactions, and their influence on society. This research aims to clarify the role of art and humanities in shaping cultural approach, identify their interactions, and assess their impact on the development of the contemporary cultural environment. Understanding these aspects will contribute to a more in-depth analysis of cultural phenomena and foster the development of a more tolerant and open society. The research is based on a combination of methods, including literature analysis, empirical studies, and philosophical analysis. The aim is to create a comprehensive understanding of the influence of art and humanities on the formation of the cultural approach. The investigation of the influence of art and humanities on cultural development is pertinent in the current era of global transformation. The research findings are anticipated to clarify the relationship between these fields and their effect on the creation of cultural identity, promoting an understanding of the significance of the cultural approach in the advancement of contemporary society. The research methodology aims to understand these processes comprehensively, serving as a basis for further scientific research and contributing to the development of cultural studies as a significant field of humanities. © 2024, Malque Publishing.

In Europe, DARIAH (Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities) has sought to develop a deeper understanding of research information and communication in the arts and humanities, and to inform the development of e-infrastructures accordingly. Both sets of activity have indicated a common requirement: to construct a framework which consistently describes the methods and functions of scholarly activity which underlie digital arts and humanities research, and the relationships between them.

Innovation is here seen as 'something new put into practical use', and there are two reasons why it can be relevant for humanities. First, there has been an expansion of what innovation refers to; it is now commonly used for non-economic change processes in public, private and non-profit organisations. Second, arts and humanities are not unique in their contribution to innovation: good teaching, research, dissemination and external relations are the central contributions for all university disciplines. But this does not mean that it is easy to promote innovation at universities in general and in arts and humanities in particular. Through examples from a historical case study at the University of Oslo, different tensions are analysed related to indicators, infrastructure, teaching versus research and quality. All these need to be handled in such a way as to avoid fruitless conflicts, misunderstandings and poorly designed policies and university strategies. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",,Arts and Humanities

This convergence has been inspired in part by the works of creative, boundary-spanning individuals and the long-standing examples of artshumanities programs in intriguing landscapes, such as artist and writer residencies of the National Park Service and the National Science Foundation's Antarctic program. In the past decade many US biological field stations, marine laboratories, and Long-Term Ecological Research sites have substantially increased the presence of arts and humanities in their programs for reasons both practical (e.g., public outreach, increasing student and class offerings) and fundamental (e.g., foster creativity within individuals and research teams, collect a record of artistic/humanities engagement with place). Motivations include communicating about science agencies' missions, the scientific process, and science discoveries to the public who support the research work. The overarching accomplishment of this work has been to advance near-term ""science outreach,"" but some of this work can be viewed as ""basic"" arts and humanities in the sense that its impacts won't be known for a long time. A next challenge is for interdisciplinary teams to address complex problems, which falls in the ""intellectual merit"" realm of the National Science Foundation evaluation criteria. The growing body of works at the ecology-arts-humanities interface will be a valuable resource for future study of science-society-nature relations. These efforts potentially contribute to initiatives emerging from the ecological sciences community that seek greater connection with society- initiatives promoting sustainability and stewardship, and the practice of science citizenship, such as development of future scenario projects and regional conservation plans. Despite the large number of programs undertaking these collaborations, their existence is a well-kept secret with little representation on individual site websites and no organized network to support the work. The strong, grassroots emergence of arts, humanities, and science collaborations at sites of long-term ecological inquiry signals a recognition that these are places of cultural as well as scientific work. Their appearance late in ESA's first century may foreshadow an important role for such endeavors in the next century of ESA. © 2015 Swanson.",,Arts and Humanities

The contributions exemplify how individuals, groups, and organizations use artistic and humanistic principles to explore new structures and novel ways of interacting to reimagine society. They refresh and reinterpret the ways in which we have traditionally assigned space and value to the arts and humanities. © 2020 by Christine Henseler. All rights reserved.",,Arts and Humanities

Despite the incredible power of existing computers, computing technology is progressing beyond today's conventional models. Quantum Computing (QC) is surfacing as a promising disruptive technology. QC is built on the principles of quantum mechanics. QC can run algorithms that are not trivial to run on digital computers. QC systems are being developed for the discovery of new materials and drugs and improved methods for encoding information for secure communication over the Internet. Unprecedented new uses for this technology are bound to emerge from ongoing research. The development of conventional digital computing technology for the arts and humanities has been progressing in tandem with the evolution of computers since the 1950s. Today, computers are absolutely essential for the arts and humanities. Therefore, future developments in QC are most likely to impact on the way in which artists will create and perform, and how research in the humanities will be conducted. This book presents a comprehensive collection of chapters by pioneers of emerging interdisciplinary research at the crossroads of quantum computing, and the arts and humanities, from philosophy and social sciences to visual arts and music.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to find out the level of satisfaction of Arts and Humanities university teaching staff towards the implementation of the EHEA. It is a population-based, descriptive study using a cross-sectional survey with a probability sample. The sample consisted of 1605 Spanish teachers of Arts and Humanities from public universities (with an average age of 48 years, of which 52 % were women and 48 % men). They were applied an ad hoc survey (α = 0.82) consisting of questions (grouped into eight sections) about the degree of satisfaction towards different aspects of the EHEA. In the results can be observed that teachers are not completely satisfied with the way in which educational institutions have adapted university education to the EHEA and they have identified certain needs that limit the quality of Arts and Humanities teaching. In conclusion, the most of teachers thought that the implementation of the EHEA could be improved, although a small percentage believed that it had not been implemented correctly. © 2019 Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.",,Arts and Humanities

The research results aim to contribute to social and cultural well-being by enhancing the understanding and application of these technologies in cultural, linguistic, and artistic domains. Through a systematic literature review based on the PRISMA protocol, using search strings in two scientific databases, 158 studies were obtained that helped address the research questions posed. The findings indicate that, in arts and humanities, emerging technologies such as virtual reality, the Internet of Things, and mobile learning are transforming creativity, teaching, and management. Identified benefits include interactive, collaborative, and innovative learning, as well as increased accessibility to education. However, challenges such as a lack of digital skills among educators, deficiencies in infrastructure, and resistance to change highlight the need for training programs and overcoming obstacles for effective implementation of these technologies in arts and humanities education. It is concluded that the integration of emerging technologies in the fields of arts and humanities presents an opportunity to promote digital intervention in social well-being, as well as to stimulate creativity and cultural exploration. These initiatives facilitate the dissemination and appreciation of cultural heritage, while also promoting community participation and strengthening an ever-evolving cultural identity. © 2024 by the authors.",,Arts and Humanities

Realizing this potential requires an understanding of what arts and humanities teaching is and what it aims to do. A 2016 review of exclusively quantitative studies mapped three discursive positions (art as intrinsic to, additive to or curative for medicine) and three epistemic functions (art for mastering skills, perspective taking, and personal growth and activism). A more inclusive sample might offer new insights into the position and function of arts and humanities teaching in medical education. Methods: Informed by this 2016 framework, we conducted discursive and conceptual analyses of 769 citations from a database created in a recent scoping review. We also analyzed the 15 stakeholder interviews from this review for recurring themes. These three analyses were iteratively compared and combined to produce a model representing the complex relationship among discursive functions and learning domains. Results: The literature largely positioned arts and humanities as additive to medicine and focused on the functions of mastering skills and perspective taking. Stakeholders emphasized the intrinsic value of arts and humanities and advocated their utility for social critique and change. We offer a refined theory of practice—the Prism Model of four functions (mastering skills, perspective taking, personal insight and social advocacy)—to support more strategic use of arts and humanities in medical education across all learning domains. Discussion: The Prism Model encourages greater pedagogical flexibility and critical reflection in arts and humanities teaching, offering a foundation for achieving its transformative potential. © 2021, The Author(s).","Curriculum; Education, Medical; Humanities; Humans; Learning; curriculum; human; humanities; learning; medical education",Arts and Humanities

These desired skills and qualities are becoming increasingly important for the physicians of tomorrow. Parallel to curricular interventions of integrating arts and humanities to medical education, there has been an increasing research interest in investigating the impact of such interventions on medical students with respect to improving and sustaining students’ empathy as they progress in their medical education and develop their professional identity. Research has yielded interesting findings on the types and effect of the interventions in the medical curriculum. The Association of the American Medical Colleges (AAMC), recognizing the unique and unrealized role of arts and humanities in preparing and equipping physicians for twenty-first-century challenges, proposed seven recommendations for advancing arts and humanities integration into medical education to improve the education, practice, and well-being of physicians and physician learners across the spectrum of medical education. Institutional initiatives of arts and humanities integration in the medical curriculum in response to the AAMC’s recommendations afford health sciences librarians expansive opportunities and a new landscape of playing an important role in these initiatives. With their diverse educational background in arts, humanities, social sciences, and many other disciplines and fields, health sciences librarians are poised for meaningful contributions to their institutional goals in developing a humanistic, compassionate workforce of future physicians. © 2022, Medical Library Association.

The results of this study reveal that the research output on the Arts and Humanities and the citations received have grown exponentially during this period especially during the 2000s with paralleling enormous changes in the research landscape. However, the research performance of the researchers in Turkey in the fields of Arts and Humanities (1,705 papers and 1,745 citations) have lagged significantly behind the comparative performance of Turkey in the Social Sciences but especially in Hard Sciences like Engineering and Health Sciences. The US, England, and France have been the three most prolific collaborating countries. The ""Bilkent Univ"" has been the most prolific institution and ""Almond I"" of ""Bogazici Univ"" has been the most prolific author. ""Milli Folklor"" (National Folklore) has been the most prolific journal whilst ""Archaeology"" has been the most prolific subject area. ""H-index"" was 16 and ""Kita & Ozyurek"" [1] has had the highest impact on the literature. The scientometric analysis has a great potential to gain valuable insights into the evolution of the research on the Arts and Humanities in Turkey, complementing the scientometric studies in the other fields such as renewable energies as well as students with disabilities providing a unique insight on the incentive structures for all the key stakeholders in the field. It was concluded in this context that the incentive structures have not been well designed to produce superior research performance in Arts & Humanities in Turkey as in Hard Sciences such as Engineering and Health Sciences especially in the design of the rules for the academic appointments and promotions in universities. © Sila Science.

Integrated arts and humanities courses have been found to serve four primary functions: mastering skills, perspective taking, personal insight, and social advocacy. To what extent and how arts and humanities programs achieve these educational outcomes remain unclear. Objective: In this study, we aimed to explore how the arts and humanities may lead to perceived benefits in clinical skills development, professional identity formation, and self-care, and to evaluate the feasibility of delivering an arts and humanities based course online. Methods: We developed and delivered a 1-week online arts and humanities course to second-through fourth-year medical students. A total of 18 students enrolled in the course across its 2 offerings in Spring 2020. The course was primarily visual arts based but also included activities based in other arts and humanities, such as literature, reflective writing, dance, film, music, philosophy, and religion. Using a mixed methods approach, daily polls assessed student engagement in and perceptions of the various activities, and a postcourse survey assessed student perceptions of the course as a whole. Results: At least 93% of poll respondents (14/15 to 17/18) across the 2 cohorts rated each type of activity as good or excellent. Qualitative analysis of student responses to the postcourse survey revealed themes concerning both the form (overall course design and online format) and the function of the course (skills development, appreciation of new perspectives, and personal inquiry). Conclusions: Results suggested that the arts and humanities may support the development of clinically relevant skills and attitudes. A more unique finding was that integrative arts and humanities courses delivered online including those that are primarily visual arts based engage students and may yield personal and professional benefits. © 2021 JMIR Medical Education.

In this article, we investigate the bibliometric characteristics of 507 arts and humanities journal articles written by authors affiliated with Turkish institutions and indexed in the Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI) between the years 1975-2003. Journal articles constituted more than 60% of all publications. One third of all contributions were published during the last 4 years (1999-2003) and appeared in 16 different journals. An overwhelming majority of contributions (91%) were written in English, and 83% of them had single authorship. Researchers based at Turkish universities produced 90% of all publications. Two thirds of references in publications were to monographs. The median age of all references was 12 years. Eighty percent of publications authored by Turkish arts and humanities scholars were not cited at all while the remaining 20% (or 99 publications) were cited 304 times (an average of three citations per publication).

Method The authors conducted a scoping review in 2019 to identify how the arts and humanities are used to educate physicians and interprofessional learners across the medical education continuum in Canada and the United States. A search strategy involving 7 databases identified 21,985 citations. Five reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts. Full-text screening followed (n = 4,649). Of these, 769 records met the inclusion criteria. The authors performed descriptive and statistical analyses and conducted semistructured interviews with 15 stakeholders. Results The literature is dominated by conceptual works (n = 294) that critically engaged with arts and humanities approaches or generally called for their use in medical education, followed by program descriptions (n = 255). The literary arts (n = 197) were most common. Less than a third of records explicitly engaged theory as a strong component (n = 230). Of descriptive and empirical records (n = 424), more than half concerned undergraduate medical education (n = 245). There were gaps in the literature on interprofessional education, program evaluation, and learner assessment. Programming was most often taught by medical faculty who published their initiatives (n = 236). Absent were voices of contributing artists, docents, and other arts and humanities practitioners from outside medicine. Stakeholders confirmed that these findings resonated with their experiences. Conclusions This literature is characterized by brief, episodic installments, privileging a biomedical orientation and largely lacking a theoretical frame to weave the installments into a larger story that accumulates over time and across subfields. These findings should inform efforts to promote, integrate, and study uses of the arts and humanities in medical education. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, by establishing their domain-specific points of view, they also provide each other with concepts, tools, theories-and recently also visualisation techniques-to interpret complex subject matters from multiple perspectives. Starting from the case of cultural collections, we explore the question of how to represent such rich historical assemblies (e.g., of images, texts, and other cultural artifacts) in newly synoptic ways. By drawing together multiple visualisation perspectives, we sketch out a multi-dimensional modeling framework (""PolyCube""), which connects map, set, and graph-based views with multiple time-based encodings. This strategy of information integration allows not only to spatialise the many data dimensions of cultural collections in a coherent fashion, but also to do so with a wide range of other data and topics from arts and humanities domains. Exemplarily, we show how biographical data about historical individuals can be translated into novel shapes of time. Tellingly, such a cross-disciplinary endeavor has become possible only due to recent developments at digital intersections (i.e., in fields such as Digital Humanities, data science or information visualisation), where the digitisation and parametrisation of formerly divided domain perspectives allows for novel exchanges on a leveled digital playing field. In this context, the indispensable views of geography meet a wide variety of 'non-geographic spatialisation techniques ' (cf. Skupin & Fabrikant, 2003) and can merge into new kinds of ""bigger pictures"" to both incorporate and transcend traditional epistemic divisions. © Finn Dammann, Dominik Kremer (eds.).",,Arts and Humanities

As in general education, wonder is central to all aspects of academic medicine's tripartite mission; a sense of wonder fuels the delivery of humanized patient care, sparks scientific discoveries, and supports engagement in lifelong learning. Despite its importance throughout medicine, developing a capacity for wonder among physicians has not been a stated goal of medical education, and innovative methods to foster a capacity for wonder have not been explored. There is a growing interest in the arts and humanities in medical education, and evidence suggests that these can support the development of a diverse array of clinically relevant skills and attitudes (including close observation, critical thinking, empathy, and tolerance for ambiguity) in medical learners across the learning continuum. However, even the potential of these methods to support a capacity for wonder has not yet been fully explored. In this article, the authors explore how one of the most widely used and studied arts-based learning activities in medical education, Visual Thinking Strategies, can help develop a capacity for wonder among physicians. They illustrate how Visual Thinking Strategies support the central elements of wonder-based pedagogy (i.e., exploration, improvisation, imagination, personal interest, and the ethos of educators) previously developed in education theory.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Curriculum; Education, Medical; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Emotions; Humanities; Humans; Learning; curriculum; education; emotion; human; humanities; learning; medical education; procedures",Arts and Humanities

Fiction in particular has led to an expansion in sympathy and a decline in social harm, and like all the arts prompts the imagination to envisage richer purposes in a richer world. Given that we need to imitate in order to innovate, the arts and the humanities, as seedbanks of the human past, make a world of difference. In our ultrasocial species, our arts, our sciences, our societies are humanities, all the way down. If we currently section off science, medicine, engineering, architecture, economics, and fine arts, even these specialisms are also all humanities, the product of human action, thought, inquiry, accumulation, contestation and preservation. In the core humanities, where we examine what we humans think and do, have thought and done, and might think and do, we need to focus more on creative problem-solving in the past and how that can help engender creativity in the present and future.

In addition, these were not always separated from the original papers, introducing ambiguity in understanding how these notices were perceived by the community (i.e. cited).

While such a system has been producing reasonably competitive technocrats, it has not reflected much upon the concept of producing well-rounded engineers. An integration of different streams of knowledge - especially liberal arts, humanities and social sciences - in the engineering curriculum would add this missing dimension. Further, the changing contours of an engineer's profession have made it necessary for one to broaden one's outlook and to be able to connect with the rest of the disciplines. Educators world over have started recognising the importance of creativity and critical thinking which are an integral part of liberal arts, humanities and social sciences. In the western context, there has been a greater emphasis on including these courses in the engineering curriculum. In the Indian context, very few institutes have made some niche efforts in including humanities components in their course package. And often, courses in communication, technical writing, principles of management etc. are counted as the only components in humanities. It is very rare for Tech schools to either have open electives or compulsory credits in humanities. This article discusses how important it is for us academics in India to look beyond imparting mere technical education and to include courses in the areas of liberal arts, humanities and social sciences. Further, it looks at how courses in creative areas that integrate science and technology with liberal arts need to be designed and offered. The article draws from the authors' experience of formulating and teaching such courses. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.",,Arts and Humanities

As a result, conservation decisions cannot rely solely on evidence from the natural sciences, but must also be guided by the social sciences, the arts and the humanities. However, we are concerned that too much of the current attention is on research that serves an instrumental purpose, by which we mean that the social sciences are used to justify and promote status quo conservation practices. The reasons for engaging the social sciences, as well as the arts and the humanities, go well beyond making conservation more effective. In this editorial, we briefly reflect on how expanding the types of social science research and the contributions of the arts and the humanities can help to achieve the transformative potential of conservation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,Arts and Humanities

Indeed, as the artist and writer Guy Davenport noted, “The vision by which we discover the hidden in nature is sometimes called science, sometimes called art.” In the last decade, the movement to integrate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics with arts and humanities (i.e., STEAM learning) has gained traction in K–12 education. A recent National Academies report (2018) examines the case for integrating humanities and the arts in undergraduate STEM education. Microscopy provides an excellent vehicle for engaging all kinds of students in integrative (STEAM) learning about biology and for encouraging them to observe the world closely. In this essay adapted from my keynote address to the American Microscopical Society in 2020, I highlight activities and approaches that use microscopy to engage learners of all kinds, examine how using microscopes changes students’ attitudes about science and biology, and explore the intersection of microscopy and visual art. © 2021 American Microscopical Society",,Arts and Humanities

Reference mining brings forward specific challenges, such as the need to capture the morphology of highly abbreviated words and the dependence among the elements of a reference, both following codified reference styles. This task is particularly difficult, and little explored, with respect to the literature in the arts and humanities, where references are mostly given in footnotes. We apply a deep learning architecture for reference mining from the full text of scholarly publications. We explore and discuss three architectural components: word and character-level word embeddings, different prediction layers (Softmax and Conditional Random Fields) and multi-task over single-task learning. Our best model uses both pre-trained word embeddings and characters embeddings, and a BiLSTM-CRF architecture. We test our solution on a dataset of annotated references from the historiography on Venice and, using a linear-chain CRF classifier as a baseline, we show that this deep learning architecture improves by a considerable margin. Furthermore, multi-task learning performs almost on par with a single-task approach. We thus confirm that there are important gains to be had by adopting deep learning for the task of reference mining. Copyright © 2018 Rodrigues Alves, Colavizza and Kaplan.",,Arts and Humanities

How might essential habits and skills necessary for engineers to meaningfully address these impacts be learned using the arts and humanities? We are exploring such questions under a grant from the National Science Foundation to develop and assess a curriculum that explores methods of fostering reflective habits and skills in graduate students through activities involving the arts and humanities. Largely informed by the theories of John Dewey, Elliot Eisner, and Donald SchÃ¶n, our experimental curriculum includes such activities as autobiographical writing with an accompanying art creation, reading about and discussing ethical dilemmas, practicing visual thinking strategies (VTS), writing weekly reflective essays, reading and discussing fiction with strong environmental justice themes, and even collaborating on art projects with graduate students in the School of Art. Incorporating aspects of the arts and humanities to complement engineering thought and action is a critical component of our work, which we describe as developing reflective engineers through artful methods. In this paper, we present findings from two instantiations of a newly designed graduate course in civil/environmental engineering that integrates the arts and humanities. The objective of our course is to develop engineers who are more reflective than traditionally trained engineers and are thereby better able to: (a) understand and address the complexities of modern real-world challenges, (b) make better ethical decisions, and (c) serve the public not only with technical engineering skills but with mindfulness of and sensitivity to the complex social, cultural, and environmental contexts their work. Thus far, results have been encouraging from both our surveys (reported here) and our analyses of student interviews and writing samples (reported elsewhere). For example, aggregate results from the pre/post Likert-type surveys (n = 19) showed statistically significant increases in Insight, which is a metacognitive factor central to the process of purposeful & directed change (p < 0.02, d > 0.3) and in Contextual Competence, which is an engineering-specific measure of contextual understand (p < 0.001, d > 0.8). We also observed potentially significant increases in Reflective Skepticism (p < 0.1, d > 0.3), which is a measure of reflection regarding the tendency to learn from one's past experiences and be questioning of evidence, and in Interdisciplinary Skills (p < 0.3, d > 0.3). These self-reported survey results, despite the small number of participants, suggest clear potential that engineering students can develop their capacity for reflection through arts- and humanities-based activities. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",Curricula; Engineers; Philosophical aspects; Surveys; Contextual competence; Critical component; Environmental contexts; Environmental justice; Interdisciplinary skills; National Science Foundations; Student interviews; Technical engineering; Students,Arts and Humanities

Scaffolding their learning in this way enables observation at close quarters of the various stages of development from early novice, just commencing clinical treatment of patients, to those approaching qualification. The students' main concerns throughout are not primarily with the technical skills required, which they have already been taught in the clinical skills laboratories, but dealing with the complex realities and ambiguities of clinical practice; the 'hidden curriculum' of decision making, judgement calls, issues of communication and what it actually means to be professional. Yet, in an already packed curriculum little time is spent helping the students develop these higher order skills. In an effort to improve clinical reasoning and interpretative skills, many medical schools in the US and a number of leading medical schools here in the UK now incorporate arts and humanities-based initiatives into their curricula. This allows for a greater balance between the objectivity of evidence-based medicine and the pluralism and subjectivity of the arts and humanities, providing a more holistic, patient-centred education that promotes a tolerance of ambiguity. In this paper, we describe a pilot programme which sought to explore the value of this approach in the context of dental education, and share early indicators that balancing interventions of this type with clinical sciences can enhance dental students' capabilities in their professional and personal development. We conclude that in today's complex world we must educate not just for competence, but for capability and that the interdisciplinarity afforded by the 'clinical humanities' is both a promising area for further educational research and potentially a valuable addition to the curriculum. © 2017 British Dental Association.

This paper discusses the use of ORCID as a digital identity platform in Social Sciences and Humanities, by analysing the adoption of ORCID in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the University of Porto using a manual-qualitative method. The results show a discrepancy between the use of ORCID as an ID and as an author record. Even though 90.4% of the sample studied had an ORCID iD, the records were found to be incomplete for disambiguation purposes. The ‘Also known as’ field was used by only 31% of the 170 profiles analysed, less than half of the profiles had completed the ‘Country’ field and the ‘Peer review’ field is hardly used. An important finding is the inconsistency in affiliation information recorded in the ‘Employment’ field. We verified that keeping profiles updated and complete requires interoperability and the role of ORCID-trusted organizations, such as the FCT in Portugal. In conclusion, it was found that a university's institutional strategy, the organizational culture and a mediation process will help improve the correct adoption of ORCID. © 2023 The Authors.

However, mechanisms for achieving these effects remain uncertain within graduate medical education. The emerging field of the positive humanities offers a lens to examine whether and how arts-based interventions support well-being in internal medicine interns. Aim: Through program evaluation of this visual art workshop, we used a positive humanities framework to elucidate potential mechanisms by which arts-based curricula support well-being in internal medicine interns. Setting: We launched the re-FRAME workshop at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in winter 2020. Participants: Fifty-six PGY-1 trainees from one internal medicine residency program. Program Description: The 3-h re-FRAME workshop consisted of an introductory session on emotional processing followed by two previously described arts-based interventions. Program Evaluation: Participants completed an immediate post-workshop survey (91% response rate) assessing attitudes towards the session. Analysis of open-ended survey data demonstrated 4 categories for supporting well-being among participants: becoming emotionally aware/expressive through art, pausing for reflection, practicing nonjudgmental observation, and normalizing experiences through socialization. Discussion: Our project substantiated proposed mechanisms from the positive humanities for supporting well-being—including reflectiveness, skill acquisition, socialization, and expressiveness—among medical interns. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of General Internal Medicine.","Burnout, Psychological; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Education, Medical, Graduate; Humanities; Humans; adult; article; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; humanities; information center; internal medicine; major clinical study; male; medical education; Pennsylvania; program evaluation; skill; socialization; wellbeing; winter; burnout; curriculum; education",Arts and Humanities

The overall publication activity and the relative share of A&H publications in relation to Ukraine's total research output, comparing them with other countries. The study analyzes the diversity and total number of sources, as well as the geographic distribution of authors and citing authors, to provide insights into the internationalization level of Ukrainian A&H research. Additionally, the topical spectrum and language usage are considered to complete the overall picture. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the Scopus database as the primary data source for analyzing the general bibliometric characteristics of Ukrainian A&H research. All document types, except Erratum, were considered. A language filter was applied to compare the bibliometric characteristics of English versus non-English publications. In addition to directly imported data from Scopus, the study employs the ready-to-use SciVal tools to operate with A&H subcategories and calculate additional bibliometric characteristics, such as Citations per Publication (CPP), Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) and journal quartiles. Information on the country of journal publishers and details on delisted journals from Scopus were obtained from the official Source Title List available on the Elsevier website and the SCImago Journal and Country Rank Portal. Findings: According to the results obtained, the publication patterns for Ukrainian A&H research exhibit dynamics comparable to those of other countries, with a gradual increase in the total number of papers and sources. However, the citedness is lower than expected, and the share of publications in top-quartile sources is lower for 2020–2021 period compared to the previous years. The impact of internationally collaborative papers, especially those in English, is higher. Nevertheless, over half of all works remain uncited, probably due to the limited readership of the journals selected for publication. Originality/value: This study provides original insights into the bibliometric characteristics of Ukrainian A&H publications between 2012 and 2021, as assessed using the Scopus database. The authors’ findings reveal that Ukraine's A&H publications have higher visibility than some Asian countries with similar population sizes. However, in comparison to other countries of similar size, Ukraine's research output is smaller. The authors also discovered that cultural and historical similarities with neighboring countries play a more significant role in publication activity than population size. This study highlights the low integration of Ukrainian A&H research into the global academic community, evident through a decline in papers published in influential journals and poor citedness. These findings underscore the importance for authors to prioritize disseminating research in influential journals, rather than solely focusing on indexing in particular databases. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,Arts and Humanities

Research suggests that AH-based pedagogies may facilitate both personal and professional transformation in medical learners, which may then further enhance the teaching and learning of social advocacy skills. However, the potential for such curricula to advance social advocacy training remains under-explored. Therefore, we sought to identify how AH may facilitate transformative learning of social advocacy in medical education. Methods: Building upon previous research, we conducted a critical narrative review seeking examples from the literature on how AH may promote transformative learning of social advocacy in North American medical education. Through a search of seven databases and MedEdPORTAL, we identified 11 articles and conducted both descriptive and interpretative analyses of their relation to key tenets of transformative learning, including: disorientation/dissonance, critical reflection, and discourse/dialogue. Results: We found that AH are used in varied ways to foster transformative learning in social advocacy. However, most approaches emphasize their use to elicit disorientation and dissonance; there is less evidence in the literature regarding how they may be of potential utility when applied to disorienting dilemma, critical reflection, and discourse/ dialogue. Discussion: The tremendous potential of AH to foster transformative learning in social advocacy is constrained due to minimal attention to critical reflection and dialogue. Future research must consider how novel approaches that draw from AH may be used for more robust engagement with transformative learning tenets in medical education. © 2024 The Author(s).","Confusion; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Humanities; Humans; Learning; confusion; curriculum; education; human; humanities; learning; medical education",Arts and Humanities

Such activities are believed to greatly enrich people’s lives. However, there is only a patchwork of research on if, when, how, and forwhom this holds true. In a large, exploratory survey of 873 U.S. residents (nationally representative with respect to gender, age, race, income, and region), participants provided descriptions of both personally significant A&H-related (a) discrete experiences (e.g., performing at a particular concert), and (b) recurrent activities (e.g., a longstanding guitar-playing hobby). Exploratory analyses addressed the following questions:What are the cognitive, affective, and situational features of discrete A&H experiences and recurrent A&H activities? What are the similarities and differences in A&H engagement across different A&H domains (e.g., music, history, etc.)? Finally, how does A&H engagement compare to non-A&H engagement (e.g., sports)? We found substantial heterogeneity across different A&H domains and contexts of engagement, as well as a range of differences between the phenomenology of A&H-related and non-A&H discrete experiences and recurrent activities. We synthesize these results to present a broad picture of the psychology of A&H engagement, laying the groundwork for focused investigations into mechanisms linking A&H engagement and well-being. © 2024 American Psychological Association",,Arts and Humanities

This paper describes a method for deriving a functional list of disciplinary lexical bundles from a corpus of academic writing, and then discusses the results quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings suggest that a small number of bundles (n=47) occur across genres, levels and institutions in the academic writing of the Arts and Humanities disciplines. Finally, a series of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) resources are presented, including a tool for finding the bundles in academic texts.

The analysis is based on a large dataset of over 11,500 research articles published in Italy in the period 2004-2010 in the areas of architecture, arts and humanities, history and philosophy, law, sociology and political sciences. These articles received a score by a large number of externally appointed referees in the context of the Italian research assessment exercise (VQR); similarly, journal scores were assigned in a panel-based independent assessment, which involved all academic journals in which Italian scholars have published, carried out under a different procedure. The score of an article is compared with that of the journal it is published in: more specifically, we first estimate an ordered probit model, assessing the probability for a paper of receiving a higher score, the higher the score of the journal; in a second step, we concentrate on the top papers, evaluating the probability of a paper receiving an excellent score having been published in a top-rated journal. In doing so, we control for a number of characteristics of the paper and its author, including the language of publication, the scientific field and its size, the age of the author and the academic status. We add to the literature on journal classification by providing for the first time a large scale test of the robustness of expert-based classification. © 2015 Bonaccorsi A et al.",architecture; art; Article; history; humanities; information processing; Italy; journal rating; law; peer review; philosophy; political science; politics; publication; quality control; scientific literature; sociology,Arts and Humanities

Arts and Humanities candidates typically navigate these moves without much of a map, choosing their own topics, avoiding the more externally defined approach available to STEM students, and mapping out their own research routes. They are often driven by desire and passion for their topic. Much of each candidate’s core identity will be inflected by this transition of emergence, a transition that involves their embodiment, emotion and social persona. With intense and sometimes uncomfortable transition in mind, and desire as driver, new materialism, namely nomadic feminism and queer theory, can inform doctoral pedagogy in Arts and Humanities. The destabilization of normativity opens the potentials and challenges of inhabited and performed identity. Queer theory’s longstanding negotiation of social and personal tensions gives a heuristic model for understanding doctoral identity transition. © The Author(s) 2017.",,Arts and Humanities

Furthermore, it argues that the theme of grammatical design awareness could be considered as a generic issue across all disciplines in the Arts and Humanities. It calls for a more explicit teaching of grammar, both in terms of understanding and application, and provides a case study to indicate how this might be achieved. It highlights the value of both schematic and formal systems when using notions of rules, grammar and contingency to assist and augment traditional pedagogical approaches used in design education.

The EU-funded project DARIAH aims to enhance and support digitally-enabled research across these disciplines. The most basic but nevertheless fundamental task of DARIAH is to provide sustainable storage for research data. Information contained in data like images, texts or music needs to be secured and to remain accessible even if the original information carrier becomes lost or corrupted. The heterogeneity of the humanistic data and the need for distributed, performant access are the main challenges in designing an archiving system for the arts and humanities. Using the ""Virtual Scriptorium"", a digitisation project in Trier, Germany, this paper exemplary identifies the humanistic researchers' storage needs and derives requirements for an infrastructure. As a solution, a generic architecture for a federated data zone based on the iRODS technologies is proposed.

Focusing on the production of what Vilém Flusser calls ‘technical images’ in video art and new media projects, he suggests that the experiment in experimental art may be rethought as a method for testing concepts and observations through the application of media technology as an apparatus. The technical image is a time-critical way to understand automatic image making devices and using this method of analysis he identifies examples where artists and humanities scholars have programmed devices to experiment with the time of contemporary media culture. Beginning with an analysis of Mark Hansen and Ben Rubin’s two works Listening Post and Moveable Type, the author uses a number of examples, from contemporary experiments with digital media to the experiments with video in the 1970s and 1980s, to show how artists and humanities scholars have used technical images to engage in experimental research outside the controlled laboratory of scientific experiments. If experimental scientists test scientific problems by developing, programming and applying an apparatus, the experimental artists identified in this article can likewise be seen to test aesthetic and cultural problems by similarly redesigning, scaling-up and experimentally applying media technology. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",,Arts and Humanities

Recent educational standards for these new programmes (NMC, 2010) allow a liberal, or broad-based, education, with its features of breadth of knowledge, formativity, critical thinking and working with others, to be considered. Objective: Select narratives from a PhD study featuring student nurses and nurse teachers exploring the relationship between reading literature and poetry and ethical practice are presented to critically support the place of liberal education within these programmes. Design: These narratives are drawn from a research study based upon the use of a narrative methodology. Settings: The study was set within the educational context of a school of nursing and midwifery in one Scottish university. Participants: Eight student nurses and four nurse teachers participated in the study. Methods: These narratives were constructed from data derived from focus groups and individual interviews. Results: These narratives suggest that liberal education can be promoted within international curricula via careful positioning of, and student nurse engagement with, the arts and humanities. A liberal education can influence student nurses' sense of discernment, enhance their own responsibility for learning, support ethical regard for others, provide different perspectives on human experience and contribute to a balanced curriculum. Although a liberal education cannot guarantee fully skilled and ethically sensitive practitioners, it can contribute towards its achievement. Conclusion: The current university education climate presents obstacles to the promotion of liberal education. Nevertheless, the considerable professional and personal challenges of nursing practice in global terms make such an educational preparation essential. If nursing education to degree level is to commence from 2013, these principal features of liberal education, via these educational standards, must be embedded prominently into new programmes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Art; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Humanities; Humans; Narration; Nursing Education Research; Nursing Evaluation Research; Nursing Methodology Research; Scotland; art; article; education; human; humanities; nursing education; nursing evaluation research; nursing methodology research; organization and management; United Kingdom; verbal communication",Arts and Humanities

This article takes as a starting point a discussion of the 'cultural value debate' as it has developed within British cultural policy: here, the discussion of 'value' has been inextricably linked to the challenge of 'making the case' for the arts and for public cultural funding. The paper discusses the problems with the persisting predominance of economics in shaping current approaches to framing articulations of 'value' in the policy-making context.

The account is structured around interpretation of the Coastal Futures Conservatory (CFC), an initiative for integrating arts and humanities into the Long-Term Ecological Research Project at the Virginia Coast Reserve. The CFC organizes collaborative inquiry and public engagement around several kinds of listening, from field recordings and designed listening stations as practices of attentiveness to scientific data by sonifying data sets, across disciplines by commissioning convergent lines of research from humanities and sciences, and across political boundaries by creating cross-coastal exchanges. Working from reflection on CFC practices, the author evaluates the potential and the limits of a pivot from ocular to aural metaphors of creating environmental knowledge as well as the potential and limits of listening as a model for integrating that knowledge. The author then questions integration as metaphor for multidisciplinary collaboration by testing its openness to listening beyond human worlds.

The most frequent problems and challenges that editors and journals face when this step has to be completed are reported and the reasons for the current situation are presented. As peer reviewing is a crucial part of the publication process, it is analyzed in detail. Special attention is paid to the importance of the final editing and proofreading of the manuscript.

Approach. An investigation into free e-books was carried out for the JISC to examine the potential for the use of free e-books in teaching and learning in further and higher education in the UK. Questionnaires, a dissemination workshop and focus groups were used to obtain the research results. Three possible approaches to evaluation are discussed, involving the collection of high-quality resources in a trusted repository, large-scale evaluation of available resources, and evaluation by end-users. The practical problems of each approach are discussed. The prospect of future large-scale digitisation projects and their possible impact in this field is also considered. In a separate section, the question of evaluation of electronic resources is briefly considered in the context of collections development in the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS). Findings. The conclusion is drawn that it is more cost-effective to intervene early in the lifecycle of a digital resource and to help ensure good practice in the creation of the resource than to attempt to evaluate and enhance a resource at the end of the creation process.

Design/methodology/approach Evidence from a number of case studies exemplifying the VRE approach is reviewed, and the case of a VRE in archaeology, the Silchester Roman Town project, is discussed in detail. The interpretive implications of using computers as a means of dealing with artistic and humanistic data, are highlighted. Findings There is a critical comparison to be drawn between VREs in the sciences and the humanities/arts. This is caused by the “fuzzy” nature of data and workflows in the latter, as compared with the more formal and definable research practice in the former. It is proposed that, to deal with this, the plan of any project which seeks to set up a VRE in the humanities should consider the research process under three headings: processes which the VRE seeks to introduce, existing processes which it seeks to undertake digitally, and processes which will be unaffected by the VRE. Originality/value In order to progress “the VRE” from being an artificial construct, driven by dedicated project funding, towards being an embedded part of research practice, those concerned with developing VREs need to consider the nuances of those research practices. This paper seeks to review those nuances by synthesizing data and experience from existing projects, thereby facilitating that embedding process. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",,Arts and Humanities

How therefore can Arts and Humanities scholars articulate the value of their work in such a way that researchers in other fields are persuaded not only that it brings something new to their understanding of the issues, but that to tackle such questions without this input would leave a significant methodological gap in developing the pathway to research impact? The present discussion takes as its central case study an analysis of the strategies at play to tackle the question of food poverty in French filmmaker Agnès Varda’s 2000 film, Les Glaneurs et la glaneuse [The Gleaners and I]. It then uses this analysis as a springboard to explore how, as Arts and Humanities scholars, we might begin to translate better our methodologies and the unique power of our objects of study to disciplines which tend to dominate research on food security, poverty and sustainability or indeed other challenge-based research. To this end, the present discussion seeks to decipher the power of this methodology in terms of the unique capacity for ‘affect’ of the work of art, and ultimately argues for the essential contribution of Arts and Humanities researchers as ‘brokers’ for movement building and social change. © 2020 by the author.",,Arts and Humanities

This phenomenon has emerged at the same time that the teaching artist field has become professionalized with new credentialed pathways through higher education. This simultaneity presents a paradox. Professionalization introduces formal standards and barriers to entry into the teaching artist field at the same time that teaching artists train youth who are racialized and low-income to become teaching artists through informal pathways in youth arts and humanities programs. In other words, the professionalization of the field is at odds with its aspiration to expand and sustain youth’s right to cultural self-determination.

However, nursing has not yet leveraged its potential to innovate to prevent AMR advancing. Aims: This paper focuses on the initial phase of an ongoing research and development study that seeks to foster nursing imagination and innovation by enhancing the meaningfulness of AMR for practising nurses and by facilitating their creative ideas. Methods: This aim is addressed through application of arts and humanities approaches, in particular the use of visualisation, co-design and historical methods, underpinned by the Design Council Double Diamond process model. The first phase with 20 UK participants explored how hospital and community-based nurses understand and respond to the priorities and consequences of AMR within their everyday working lives. Results: Nurses varied in their conceptualisations of AMR and in their depictions and explanations of its meaning and priority within everyday practices. Some saw infection prevention and control as bound up with AMR, whereas others differentiated in the context of specific work activities. Insights into related reasoning and practice tactics were also generated. Conclusions: The initial project phase provides a basis for fostering nursing innovation in this important field. © The Author(s) 2020.",,Arts and Humanities

Yet the contemporary student of leadership often overlooks many of these names in favor of more recent theorists hailing from the social sciences. Understanding Leadership: An Arts and Humanities Perspective takes a different angle, employing the works of the great philosophers, authors, and artists found in world civilization and presenting an arts and humanities perspective on the study of leadership. The authors build their conceptual framework using their Five Components of Leadership Model, which recognizes the leader, the followers, the goal, the context, and the cultural values and norms that make up the leadership process. Supporting the text are a wealth of case studies that reflect on works such as Ayn Rand's novella Anthem, Eugène Delacroix's painting Liberty Leading the People, Charlie Chaplin's film Modern Times, Athol Fugard's play ""Master Harold"" . . . and the boys, Laozi's poetic work Dao De Jing, and Antonín Dvorák's New World Symphony. The authors also introduce studies from various world cultures to emphasize the role that cultural values and norms play in leadership. This illuminating framework promotes the multidimensional thinking that is necessary for understanding and problem-solving in a complex world. Understanding Leadership: An Arts and Humanities Perspective will be a valuable resource for both undergraduate and postgraduate leadership students, while leadership professionals will also appreciate the book's unique liberal arts and cultural approach. © Robert M.

One response to this crisis has been the emergence of Open Access (OA) publishing, bringing scholarly literature out from behind a paywall and making it freely available to anyone online. Many research and academic libraries are facilitating the change to OA by establishing institutional repositories, supporting OA policies, and hosting OA journals. In addition, research funding bodies, such as the Australian Research Council (ARC), are mandating that all published grant research outputs be made available in OA, unless legal and contractual obligations prevent this. Despite these broader changes, not all scholars are aware of the new publishing environment. In particular, the rate of adoption of OA models in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) has historically been lower than Science, Technology and Medicine (STM) disciplines. Nevertheless, some local and international OA exemplars exist in HSS. At Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, the faculty-administered environmental humanities journal, Landscapes, was migrated to the institutional open access repository in 2013. Subsequently, researchers in the Faculty of Education and Arts were surveyed regarding their knowledge, understandings, and perceptions of OA publishing. The survey was also designed to elicit the barriers to OA publishing perceived or experienced by HSS researchers. This article will present the findings of our small faculty-based OA survey, with particular attention to HSS academics (and within this subject group, particular attention to the arts and humanities), their perceptions of OA, and the impediments they encounter. We argue that OA publishing will continue to transform scholarship within the arts and humanities, especially through the role of institutional repositories. The “library-as-publisher” role offers the potential to transform academic and university-specific publishing activities. However, the ongoing training of university researchers and personnel is required to bring into balance their understandings of OA publisher and the demands of the broader Australian and international research environment. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,Arts and Humanities

The analysis was conducted via language of the journal title and published papers, national distribution of authors and co-authorship structure, as well as via the INO indicator. SS journals were divided into those related to medicine and health (SSM) and other SS journals (SSO), while A&H journals were observed as one group (AH). Croatian SSM journals are the most internationally oriented according to all indicators, while the SSO journals have the strongest national orientation. Howevper, all three analyzed groups of journals are still the most attractive first for Croatian authors, and then to authors from the region (SSO, SSM) and top 20 countries in the world's science (AH).",,Arts and Humanities

No systematic survey of digital resource usage in the humanities has ever been undertaken - and the factors for use and non-use of digital resources are unknown. The LAIRAH (Log Analysis of Internet Resources in the Arts and Humanities) Project is a 15-month long study into the factors which determine long-term use and neglect of digital resources in the Arts and Humanities. Using quantitative Deep Log Analysis techniques to understand real-time user behaviour and qualitative user workshops to gain an understanding of user approaches to digital resources in the arts and humanities, the study identifies factors that may predispose a digital resource to become used or neglected in the long-term. This article provides an overview of the techniques used in the LAIRAH project, and presents some preliminary results that may be of use to both the creators of digital resources in the humanities, and the funders of these projects, to ensure that significant intellectual effort and time, and financial resources, are not wasted in the creation of projects that are then neglected by the user community. © The Author 2007.

In this light, the question arises as to what evidence the history of neurotechnologies provides at the intersection of creativity and aesthetic experience. Methods: We conducted a century-long bibliometric analysis of key parameters in multidisciplinary studies published in the Scopus database. Screening techniques based on the PRISMA method and advanced data analysis techniques were applied to 3612 documents metadata from the years 1922 to 2022. We made graphical representations of the results applying algorithmic and clusterization processes to keywords and authors relationships. Results: From the analyses, we found a) a shift from a personality-focus quantitative analysis to a field-focus qualitative approach, considering topics such as art, perception, aesthetics and beauty; b) The locus of interest in fMRI-supported neuroanatomy has been shifting toward EEG technologies and models based on machine learning and deep learning in recent years; c) four main clusters were identified in the study approaches: humanistic, creative, neuroaesthetic and medical; d) the neuroaesthetics cluster is the most central and relevant, mediating between creativity and neuroscience; e) neuroaesthetics and neuroethics are two of the neologism that better characterizes the challenges that this convergence of studies will have in the next years. Conclusions: Through a longitudinal analysis, we evidenced the great influence that neuroscience is having on the thematic direction of the arts and humanities. The perspective presented shows how this field is being consolidated and helps to define it as a new opportunity of great potential for future researchers. © 2023, The Author(s).",Art; Cognition; Creativity; Humanities; Neurosciences; algorithm; bibliometrics; creativity; data analysis; deep learning; electroencephalogram; esthetics; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; machine learning; metadata; neuroanatomy; neuroscience; nomenclature; perception; personality; quantitative analysis; review; Scopus; systematic review; tertiary education; art; cognition; humanities,Arts and Humanities

Responses also showed that for most publishers OA publication stands at under 25% of output and that fewer than 10% of authors enquire about OA publication options. Continuing problem areas highlighted by respondents were the clearing of rights for OA publication and the standardisation of title and usage metadata. All responding organisations confirmed that they expect to be publishing monographs in ten years’ time, but that they anticipate the format and/or the model will be different, with open access expected to play a key part in the future, perhaps in the context of a mixed economy of OA and ‘toll access’ publication. © 2023, The Author(s).",,Arts and Humanities

Furthermore, it is not commonly known by industry and policymakers that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Frascati Manual – the internationally accepted methodology for collecting and reporting data on R&D – formally recognises the arts, humanities and social sciences (AHSS) in R&D. The UK collects data on R&D using the Frascati Manual definition. However, arguably, what matters for the UK is how R&D is defined for policy purposes. For example, the UK tax authorities choose to explicitly exclude AHSS R&D from their definitions for the purpose of tax relief. This paper explores the role of AHSS R&D in UK business. Drawing upon a review of the policy literature and interviews with 13 businesses that undertake AHSS research, and an additional 14 interviews with policymakers and other stakeholders, the paper presents recommendations for government, funders and business, and it concludes that more inclusive definitions and data are important for evidence-informed policy. Without the right definitions and tools to measure it and effective policies in place to support it, the Government risks ignoring the full value of R&D in the UK economy, and missing out on incentivising investment in innovation in AHSS-related sectors and activities. © 2021, British Academy.

This is likely to affect the way biological sciences are viewed as subjects within the curriculum. The aim of this study was to investigate the status of biological sciences in the curriculum following educational reform. A small-scale, descriptive study was undertaken investigating one institution. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered using a postal questionnaire; this was complemented by contextual information obtained from documents. Findings indicated that there was a lack of consensus amongst teachers regarding what emphasis should be given to different subjects within the curriculum. It was commented that 'nursing' may have been displaced by pure subject disciplines, and that application of biological theory to practice was inadequate. Biological sciences, social sciences and behavioural sciences were allotted equal hours in the curriculum; concern was expressed, however, that there was insufficient time available for some subjects. This appeared to foster competition and tension, in particular between proponents of biological and social sciences. Teachers demonstrated subject loyalty, and promoted their own discipline within the curriculum. In an attempt to explain findings a conceptual framework based upon the sociology of knowledge and conflicts and tensions between groups within a profession was employed. Issues identified in the study suggest that there is cause for concern with respect to the structuring, teaching and learning of biological concepts, and their application to nursing practice.","Biological Sciences; Curriculum; Decision Making, Organizational; Education, Nursing; England; Faculty, Nursing; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; article; biomedicine; curriculum; education; human; nursing education; organization; organization and management; public relations; United Kingdom",Biological Sciences

The article describes some of the main didactic resources producing greater visual impact in the students and turning into meaningful learning through their incorporation into the cerebral cortex. Findings suggest that the individuals' learning is mediated by the nervous system and the sensory organs. Likewise, studies have verified that the sense of sight is the system of primary representation for most human beings, and the teaching strategies combining vision with hearing have considerable possibilities of being more effective.

Scenarios characterized by the availability of limited amount of sample data, which are common in domains such as radiation biology, are of particular interest. We find that when estimating a distribution density function given limited amount of sample data, adaptive transport maps are advantageous. In particular, statistics gathered from computing series of adaptive transport maps, trained on a series of randomly chosen subsets of the set of available data samples, leads to uncovering information hidden in the data. As a result, in the radiation biology application considered here, this approach provides a tool for generating hypotheses about gene relationships and their dynamics under radiation exposure. © 2024 Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC.

Electron microscopic studies in the biomedical fields were carried out in only a few research laboratories under an effective cooperation of bio-scientists and technical engineers of electron optics. A number of high-voltage electron microscopes were provided for general use in several universities and institutes. The quick-freezing method was much improved in the late 1970s and has become the focus of wide attention as the most desirable method to preserve the fine structural features and components of cells and tissues to reflect their living state.",Biology; Electron microscopy; Electrons; Research laboratories; Biological science; Biomedical fields; Desirable methods; Freezing methods; High voltage electron microscope; Japan society for the promotion of science; Microscopic study; Structural feature; Electron microscopes,Biological Sciences

We need to reframe how we view outliers to improve our understanding of biology. These rare events are often treated as problematic or spurious, when they can be real rare events or individuals driving evolution in a population. It is our perspective that to understand what outliers can tell us in our data, we need to: (1) Change how we think about our data philosophically, (2) Fund novel collaborations using science weavers in our national funding agencies, and (3) Bridge long-term feld and lab studies to reveal these outliers in action. By doing so, we will improve our understanding of variation and evolution. We propose that this shift in culture towards more integrative science will incorporate diverse teams, citizen scientists and local naturalists, and change how we teach future students.  © The Author(s) 2021.

The following parameters were shown to have a significant effect on biological science examination results: 1. Studied biology previously, x2 = 48.06, DF = 20, n = 112 (significant at 0.001); 2. Level of achievement in school biology, x2 = 11.15, DF = 8, n = 104 (significant at 0.05); 3. Attendance in class, x2 = 60.71, DF = 36, n = 201 (significant at 0.001); 4.

Are nursing students of today giving themselves a decent chance through their study and attendance behaviour in a busy demanding course? Is overloading within the curriculum leading to these behaviours? This study shows that poor previous theoretical biological science significantly influenced biological science examination results.

The objective of the study was to determine the effect of the management of online resources that the teacher had on the valuation of the advantages of online classes in biological sciences, mediated by the students’ perception of virtual practices as well as the accessibility and use of online resources. A total of 332 Peruvian students studying in biological sciences from a public university, enrolled in five undergraduate academic years, of which 184 were women and 148 were men, participated. A non-experimental predictive design of causal relationships was used with the methodology of structural equation modeling. According to the SEM model (CFI and TLI > 0.95, RMSEA and SRMR < 0.05), the valuation of the advantages of virtual classes during the pandemic was significantly predicted by the valuation of virtual practices (positively) as well as by the accessibility and management of online resources by students (negatively); likewise, the use and mastery of digital and online resources by teachers had an indirect effect on the valuation of virtual classes, but direct effects on virtual practices and accessibility to digital resources by students. Also, virtual practice was the most crucial variable in predicting the valuation of online classes (β = 0.48, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the student’s perception of the teachers’ handling of online resources during the COVID-19 pandemic was determinant as a favorable valuation of the advantages offered by online classes, a relationship that is mediated by virtual practices and accessibility to online resources. © 2023 by the authors.",,Biological Sciences

The current generation of biological science students at university holds promise for better future medicine and medical technology. However, their physical fitness and lifestyle are often ignored. Methods: Lifestyle, PAs and common risk factors for cardiovascular disease before, and at, university were collected from 408 students using self-completed, anonymous surveys between the academic years of 2017 and 2019 from the School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS® 9.4 software. Results: Among the 408 participants, 134 were male and 274 were female with a mean (SD) age of 19.6 (2.24). Approximately 19% of participants consumed alcohol beyond the safe limit of <14 units/week (112 g/week). Among them, 65% were males. Before university, 47% of students failed to meet the UK National Physical Activity Guidelines (NPAG) which increased to 56% during university with males exhibiting a steeper incline. Compared to their lifestyles before university, more students had insufficient sleep and displayed greater sedentariness during university. Moreover, 16% of students declared no engagement in PA which was greater than the value of 12% before university. Fitness perceptions worsened by 11% during university particularly for females. Statistical analysis revealed that gender, BMI and fitness perceptions were significantly correlated with PA levels. The most prevalent explanation for inadequacy in meeting NPAG was insufficient time. Conclusions: Compared to their pre-university lifestyles, biological science students at university are more likely to adopt unhealthier behaviours with less time for exercise and prolonged sedentary behaviours, which increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases. It is important to raise awareness of their fitness perceptions and to encourage health-promoting programmes at university. © Royal Society for Public Health 2019.",Adolescent; Biological Science Disciplines; Female; Health Behavior; Healthy Lifestyle; Humans; Male; Risk Reduction Behavior; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom; Universities; Young Adult; adaptive behavior; adult; alcohol consumption; attitude to health; biomedicine; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular risk; Caucasian; exercise; female; fitness; health promotion; healthy lifestyle; human; life expectancy; male; obesity; physical activity; prevalence; Review; sedentary lifestyle; sex difference; sleep deprivation; sleep time; smoking; student attitude; undergraduate student; university student; young adult; adolescent; biomedicine; education; health behavior; psychology; questionnaire; risk reduction; student; United Kingdom; university,Biological Sciences

Skinner focused on behavior as a naturally occurring biological phenomenon of interest in its own right, functionally related to surrounding events and, in particular (like phylogenesis), subject to selection by its consequences. This essentially biological orientation was further enhanced by Skinner's emphasis on the empirical foundations provided by laboratory-based experimental analyses of behavior, often with nonhuman subjects. Skinner's theoretical writings, however, also have affinity with the traditions of constructionist social science. The verbal behavior of humans is said to be subject, like other behavior, to functional analyses in terms of its environment, in this case its social context. Verbal behavior in turn makes it possible for us to relate to private events, a process that ultimately allows for the development of consciousness, which is thus said to be a social product. Such ideas make contact with aspects of G. H. Mead's social behaviorism and, perhaps of more contemporary impact in psychology, L. Vygotsky's general genetic law of cultural development.

This article draws on previously unused archival material to establish a starting point for further study of the biological sciences at Stanford. It traces the evolution of Stanford's biological sciences through three experimental fields: self-directed developmental and evolutionary studies; fundamental research at the molecular level; and biomedical applications of fundamental knowledge. Taken together, a history of Stanford's biological sciences offers a remarkably fertile example of organizational flexibility in historical context.

METHODS: A total of 268 sensation-seeking questionnaires were distributed to second- and third-year male and female dental and biological science students, studying for a degree at the University of Manchester. Each questionnaire was scored against Zuckerman's sensation-seeking scale. RESULTS: A total of 268 questionnaires were distributed, 175 were returned. The return rate was 65%. The primary findings were: Biological Science students were more sensation-seeking in the dimensions of disinhibition and experience-seeking than dental students (P < 0.05). There was a significant gender bias in sensation-seeking. Males were significantly more sensation-seeking than females in both courses (P < 0.05). Males in both courses had similar sensation-seeking tendencies (NS). Females in the biological sciences course were less inhibited than their dental counterparts (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was a clear difference in sensation-seeking within and between groups of dental students and students studying biological sciences.","Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Attitude; Biological Sciences; Boredom; Case-Control Studies; England; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Questionnaires; Risk-Taking; Sex Factors; Sexual Behavior; Social Behavior; Students; Students, Dental; adolescent; adult; article; attitude; biomedicine; boredom; case control study; comparative study; dental student; drinking behavior; education; female; high risk behavior; human; male; motivation; psychological aspect; questionnaire; sex difference; sexual behavior; social behavior; student; United Kingdom",Biological Sciences

The bibliometric analysis of the content of this journal in time span 1886-2010 provided an insight into the structure of scientific communication in the field of biology in Croatia with a purpose to present trends and development of specific biological disciplines. Materials and Methods: The analysed sample consists of 1,347 articles classified into eight biological disciplines and 40 subdisciplines over a 122-year period, 1886-2010. In order to provide easier assessment of the development of biological sciences and presenting results, the publishing period of journal has been divided into functional periods. Results and Conclusion: Since the beginning of its publication until the 1950s, the fields of study predominant in the journal involved classic biological disciplines of zoology and botany, i.e. their mostly descriptive subdisciplines. From the 1970s onwards, biological disciplines and subdis-ciplines in the journal have been developed in accordance to global trends, with domination of experimental fields of molecular biology, immunology, physiology etc. Despite the fact that research was conducted only with a purpose to enhance the development of biological sciences in Croatia, this journal also presents an important communication media in biomedical disciplines and subdisciplines. A detailed scientometric analysis might help the journal editorial board to reach decisions concerning journal's future development more easily.",article; astronomy; biochemistry; biomedicine; botany; chemistry; ecology; geology; human; immunology; marine biology; mathematics; microbiology; molecular biology; natural science; paleoanthropology; physics; physiology; prevalence; publication; publishing; research; scientific literature; zoology,Biological Sciences

Design/methodology/approach – Based on a qualitative methodology, a series of interviews were carried out with researchers from the biological sciences domain. Findings – This study found that, at the outset of U-I links, companies’ motivations are strongly organizational, while academics are motivated at a personal level. The interactions grow from low-risk activities to partnerships on complex tasks, and depend on relational resources framed within the ARA and social capital theories. Results showed that shared interests are present at the outset of U-I links and grow thereafter. Trust and commitment were not ubiquitous at the outset, but rather at later stages of the cooperation, as a result of the developed interdependencies. Research limitations/implications – The combination of the ARA model and social capital in U-I links highlighted the different relationship levels (individual vs organizational), the disparities between early and established ties, and the interplay between low- and high-investment activities underlying researchers’ relationships. Several managerial contributions are presented for universities to promote greater integration with industry partners. Originality/value – A new direction of research is presented towards lower levels of U-I cooperation, taking into account the relational resources and the activities shared in each level. This work distinguished the different actors’ motivations and clarified the role of trust and commitment at the outset of U-I links. This first assessment of Portuguese U-I interactions within the biological sciences provided valuable insights for both academics and practitioners. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited 1460-1060.",,Biological Sciences

Thirty-nine faculty members published a total of 640 publications during the period, representing an average of 16.4 publications per scientist. Among the 640 publications, 521 (81.4 %) were cited 9,204 times, an average of 14.4 citations per publication. More publications co-authored by the SBS faculty with foreign researchers (mostly from the U.S.A.) were published in mainstream journals than publications by three other co-authorship types. Accordingly, publications by international co-authorships received more citations compared to citation levels of three other co-authorship types in terms of the average citations per publication. The study has found a concentration effect, whereby quite a small number of publications received approximately one-third of the citation performance generated by the SBS faculty at SNU. The results demonstrate that the citation performance of the SBS at SNU can be influenced considerably by the presence and productivity of 'star' scientists. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",,Biological Sciences

As such, a number of so-called life detection technologies, instruments, and approaches have been applied as part of past, current, and future space missions. As astrobiology is a truly interdisciplinary field within the realm of space exploration with major contributions from physical and biological sciences (among others), recently there has been development of a number of relevant techniques from scientific fields that have yet to be fully applied to extraterrestrial life detection. As a culmination of the 2021 Blue Marble Space Institute of Science (BMSIS) Young Scientist Program (YSP), we present a number of techniques drawn from various fields (including, but not limited to, chemistry, materials science, biology, nanotechnology, medical science, astrophysics, and more) that either have been or have the potential to be applied to life detection research. These techniques broadly fall under three categories: instrumentation for in situ measurements of biosignatures within the solar system, calculations or observational techniques for remote measurements of exoplanet biosignatures, and technosignatures. We hope that this primer serves to inspire the field to consider applying more potential technologies from adjacent fields into any of these three categories of life detection.

Due to the need to prepare teachers to work with the themes of Sexuality Education in schools, the MEC Resolution No. 2, of July 1, 2015, provides for the inclusion of such themes in the curricula of undergraduate courses in teaching, along with it the National Curriculum Guidelines for Basic Education (MEC, 2013b), who also mention the need for inclusion of themes in teacher education.

Finally, with this research, it can be observed that the analyzed educational institutions still show a certain resistance regarding the inclusion of the themes of sexuality in their curricula, and when this occurs, the subjects directed to the biological area, gain more prominence, when compared to other themes, related to the affective or social. © 2020 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Instituto de Fisica.

These are contrasted to inexact sciences, whose theories are not formalized. Formalization is described as a broader category than mathematization, involving any form/content distinction allowing forms, e.g., as represented in theoretical models, to be studied independently of the empirical content of a subject-matter domain. Exactness is a practice depending on the use of theories to control subject-matter domains and to align theoretical with empirical models and not merely a state of a science. Inexact biological sciences tolerate a degree of “mismatch” between theoretical and empirical models and concepts. Three illustrations from biological sciences are discussed in which formalization is achieved by various means: Mendelism, Weismannism, and Darwinism. Frege’s idea of a “conceptual notation” is used to further characterize the notion of a form/content distinction. © 2012, Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research.",,Biological Sciences

The study adopted a mixed-methods approach in which quantitative and qualitative data have provided complementary insights into the beliefs and approaches adopted by these students. Our findings indicate that most students tend to adopt beliefs that knowledge and learning involves the accumulation of information and the capacity to reproduce on demand in examinations. Approaches to learning reflect these beliefs and are dominated by rote learning and preference for assessment by examination.

These “stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency” (STAP) cells were shown to be capable of contributing to all cell types of a developing embryo, and extra-embryonic tissues. The lead author of the publications, Haruko Obokata, became an overnight celebrity in Japan, where she was dubbed the new face of Japanese science. However, in the weeks that followed publication of the research, issues arose. Other laboratories and researchers (including authors on the original papers) found that they were unable to replicate Obokata et al.’s work. Closer scrutiny of the papers by the scientific community also suggested that there was manipulation of images that had been published, and Obokata was accused of misconduct. Those who should have been supervising her work (also her co-authors on the publications) were also heavily criticised. The STAP cell saga of 2014 is used as an example to highlight the importance of trust and replication in twenty-first century biological science. The role of trust in the scientific community is highlighted, and the effects on interactions between science and the public examined. Similarly, this essay aims to highlight the importance of replication, and how this is understood by researchers, the media, and the public.

This claim will be demonstrated by using three case studies from biology: The structuring of data categories for data collection tables and models; establishing spatial and temporal threshold markers or limits; and the comparative use of phenomenal characteristics as cues for object identification. By drawing from examples of data classification and comparative analysis in the biological sciences, I offer a view about ‘individuation’ as double-barreled according to the method of co-constitutive conceptual analysis. Specifically, the capacity—i.e., the ability to individuate—is co-constituted by community level choices and agent applications: Individuation’s evidential role is generated, revised, and refined by scientific communities and their members through an iterative process of community and agent-level interactions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",biology; classification; comparative study; conceptual framework; constitutive equation; data set; numerical model; spatiotemporal analysis; threshold,Biological Sciences

In this scenario, we sought through this study to analyze the conceptions and scientific knowledge of students in the course of Biological Sciences of Feevale University about biological evolution, natural selection and species diversity, identifying the main forming influences of these opinions, performing a comparative analysis between the conceptions of beginners and graduates of the course, with the objective of verifying the construction of scientific knowledge in the graduation. As a methodology we chose a exploratory quantitative-qualitative approach, through the collection of data with the use of structured questionnaires, adapted from recent searches. The analyzed group was composed of 39 students, being 15 beginners and 24 graduates, the majority bachelor (60%). Through this research, we found that the students have an incipient knowledge about the theme, with misconceptions of biological evolution and natural selection. The results, in general, have demonstrated that students understand the Evolutionary Biology as a set of processes that allow the improvement and/or enhancement of anatomical and physiological characteristics of living organisms It was also observed that the conceptions of evolutionary theory are influenced by religious precepts of students, where there is constant dichotomy between science and religion and are directly related to a deficiency at the teaching this topic in basic education.

However, universities are known to present unique issues around the development, and practice, of good leadership. Good leadership skills should be considered essential for university staff who train (and mentor) staff or students. Currently, there is no clear evidence that staff in the biological (life) sciences undergo formal (routine) leadership skills training (or appraisal). Furthermore, what leadership training this group needs, or wants, is unknown. A questionnaire was designed to explore leadership dimensions (roles, training, perceptions, and attitudes), and incorporated the Leadership Attitudes and Belief scale (LABS) instrument. Including LABS allows evaluation of leadership attitudes as either Systemic (individual responsibility) or Hierarchical (chain-of-command). Self-selecting biological science academics and staff were recruited using an online survey. Analysis focused on academic staff (lecturer/Assistant professor, and above), and explored the relationship of leadership dimensions with key categories (career stage, gender, age, role, and professional experience). Staff were found to be knowledgeable about what leadership is, but strongly desire formal training in leadership skills and practice. Importantly, staff did not have access to specific leadership training (but did have access to management training), but felt strongly that gaining leadership skills would improve their professional skill set. Analysis found that academics in the biological sciences were oriented towards Systemic leadership, a more collective and supportive approach. It was clear that while good leadership skills are highly valued by academic staff, in practice these skills are underprovided in the biological sciences workplace. This work provides a profile, and benchmark, of leadership (current skills, and desired needs) in the biological sciences. These results provide evidence for the need to embed specific leadership skills training into professional development (and teaching) programmes in the biological sciences. © 2023 James A. L. Brown.

This approach is demonstrated for all N= 149,129 ISI-indexed publications in biological sciences journals during 2017. A Bayesian multinomial inverse regression approach is used to extract rankings of topics without the need of a pre-defined dictionary. Bigrams are used for extraction of research topics across manuscripts, and rankings of research topics are constructed by quartile. Worldwide and local results (e.g., comparison between two peer/aspirational research institutions in Colombia) are provided, and differences are explored both at the global and local levels. Some topics persist across quartiles, while the relevance of others is quartile-specific. Challenges in sustainable development appear as more prevalent in top quartile journals across institutions, while the two Colombian institutions favour plant and microorganism research. This approach can reduce information inequities, by allowing young/incipient researchers in biological sciences, especially within lower income countries or universities with limited resources, to freely assess the state of the literature and the relative likelihood of publication in higher impact journals by research topic. This can also serve institutions of higher education to identify missing research topics and areas of competitive advantage.  © 2022-IOS Press.

The said application runs in iOS that integrates AR technology education which may help the teachers in facilitating delivery of the daily lessons using a realistic representation of objects for a better learning experience. It may also assist the teachers to monitor the performance of the students when using AR lesson. Moreover, the students may enjoy ARTitser application because they will see 3D objects associated to biology lesson. Based on the result of the survey, the respondents highly recommended the ARTitser with a grand mean of 4.52 which is highly acceptable. Thus, the said tool can be implemented in the Junior High School students which may motivate as well as improve the performance of the students. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Augmented reality; Biology; Educational technology; Learning systems; Surveys; Biological science; Interactive learning tools; Junior high schools; Learning experiences; Mobile applications; Mobile augmented reality; Mobile Learning; Technology education; Students,Biological Sciences

Objective: To better understand their contributions, in this paper we take an historical tour, with emphasis on the last century and a half, regarding the motivations that attracted these people to Costa Rica, as well as their specific scientific contributions. Methods: Six criteria were followed to address this issue: a) whether they were residents or itinerants; b) if they had a frequent relationship with Costa Rica; c) if they collected specimens; d) the type of publication; and e) whether to implement teaching or institutional management. Results: Therefore, the information is organized into six large sections, structured chronologically as follows: the first inventories of the biodiversity of Costa Rica (1513-1842), the recognition of biological sciences in Costa Rican culture (1839-1848), the insertion of biological sciences in Costa Rican culture (1854-1886), the institutionalization of the biological sciences in Costa Rica (1886-1900), Costa Rica as a mecca for biological explorations (1900-1957), and the training of professionals in biological sciences (1940-2021). Conclusion: This periodization allows us to contextualize the contributions of those naturalists or scientists in time, as well as to better visualize the economic, social and political events and circumstances that conditioned their scientific work. © 2023, Universidad de Costa Rica.

Adv Physiol Educ 44: 99-103, 2020; doi:10.1152/advan.00144.2019.-Experiential learning experiences (ELEs), opportunities for students to apply knowledge and skills critically in a hands-on environment, are fundamental to the apprenticeship model of biological and biotechnological sciences. ELEs enhance student-learning gains, increase career readiness, and provide important networking opportunities. However, students do not often recognize the benefits of ELEs. Reflection is a highly effective tool to articulate learning gains and connect new content with established knowledge. Therefore, senior undergraduate students (n β 23), majoring in biological sciences or biotechnology, wrote required reflective essays about their ELE, in response to an intentionally vague prompt. Qualitative assessment of the reflective essays identified themes present in the reflective essays that typically included descriptions of what students did, with whom they worked, and what they learned during their ELE, but lacked critical analysis or deep reflection about their experience. Differences were also present between different types of ELEs. These results provide a foundation for guiding students to deeper reflection, ultimately resulting in greater benefits from their ELEs. To promote more robust reflection, and, therefore, theoretically enhance learning gains from ELEs, we suggest multiple iterations of reflection, instructor feedback and coaching, and ELE-specific prompts that focus on the placement of ELEs within students' personal and professional trajectory. © 2020.",Biological Science Disciplines; Biotechnology; Female; Humans; Male; Problem-Based Learning; Students; Universities; biomedicine; biotechnology; education; female; human; male; problem based learning; procedures; psychology; student; university,Biological Sciences

Long before the employability at Higher Education can be considered, the transition between Secondary and Higher Education must be. Students doing biological sciences degrees at a UK university were surveyed to ascertain the factors that prepared students best for the quantitative nature of a biological sciences degree. Student perceptions of biological sciences as a quantitative subject altered once they began their degree's. Students who studied mathematics post-16 felt more prepared for the quantitative nature of their biological sciences degree while Secondary level biology does not prepare. Post-16 mathematics is only an entry requirement for 1of 49 biological sciences courses across the UK’s Russell Group universities. Most students do not feel prepared by their Secondary Education for the quantitative nature of a biological sciences degree and Higher Education Institutions do not ask for quantitative qualifications.

The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics of the scientific production and the contributions to the biomedical sciences of the Faculty of Biological Sciences of Pedro Ruiz Gallo National University, Peru (FCCBB-UNPRG). A descriptive study with a bibliometric approach was carried out. Three databases (Scopus, PubMed, and LILACS) were consulted to search for articles that had, at least, one author affiliated with the FCCBB-UNPRG. The following data were recorded: type of publication, language, authorship data, funding, year, publication area, journal data, and collaborating institutions. A descriptive analysis was carried out and network maps were elaborated, using the VOSviewer software. Forty-six documents were retrived; the majority were articles (n = 36, 78.26%), letters (n = 9, 19.57%) and case reports (n = 1, 2.17%); published in 30 scientific journals, mainly foreign. Greater contribution was observed in microbiology, virology and parasitology. Fotry-two collaborative institutions were involved. About 90% of the publications were not funded. A growth in the number of publications in different thematic areas has been noted in recent years, which demonstrates the commitment of FCCBB-UNPRG to research in the biomedical field and the training of researchers.

After consideration of the complexity of the issues involved and the precise nature of the undertaking, in August 2011, the BOD empanelled a Cancer Biology/Radiation Biology Task Force (TF). The TF was charged with developing an accurate snapshot of the current state of basic (preclinical) research in radiation oncology from the perspective of relevance to the modern clinical practice of radiation oncology as well as the education of our trainees and attending physicians in the biological sciences. The TF was further charged with making suggestions as to critical areas of biological basic research investigation that might be most likely to maintain and build further the scientific foundation and vitality of radiation oncology as an independent and vibrant medical specialty. It was not within the scope of service of the TF to consider the quality of ongoing research efforts within the broader radiation oncology space, to presume to consider their future potential, or to discourage in any way the investigators committed to areas of interest other than those targeted.

TL should be understood as a reflective, critical, holistic, interactive, and constructive approach that combines points of view and habits of mind to form frames of reference, identities, autonomies, and perceptions of students. Thus, the present study aimed to identify and analyze possible indicators of transformative learning. To do so, eight recorded classes from a course in biological sciences at a private university in the central region of São Paulo, Brazil, were analyzed. The selected statements from three female students were analyzed using four categories to determine the level of learning for each of them. It was observed that transformative learning (TL) is possible through conceptions of reflective and dialogical learning, where intentionality and planning are linked to knowledge construction that considers the actors involved in the process, including managers, teachers, students, and the reality in which they all live. © 2023 IMCIC.All Rights Reserved.",Biological science; Common sense; Constructive approach; Critical approach; Frames of reference; Holistic approach; Interactive approach; Sao Paulo; Science course; Transformative learning; Students,Biological Sciences

Using a longitudinal quasi-experiment, we tested the impacts of a living learning community (LLC) in the biological sciences on FG students in their first year of college (Semester 1: N = 243; Semester 2: N = 199), across three cohorts (2018–2019, 2019–2020 and 2020–2021). Participation in the LLC enhanced FG students’ belonging, confidence, motivation, grades, knowledge of the social relevance of biology, and reduced STEM anxiety compared to a control group of FG students not in an LLC. LLC participation also increased retention in biological science majors one-year post-intervention compared to the control FG group. Moreover, LLC participation closed the academic gap between FG students in the LLC and honors students from college-educated families in a separate honors LLC. Benefits of the LLC intervention remained stable despite the COVID-19 pandemic, when living together became impossible, producing positive effects across cohorts from pre-pandemic to in-pandemic.

The rapid progress of MUBSB in recent years is apparently due to the journal having been distributed since 2007 by the internationally renowned Springer publishing consortium that places electronic versions of all articles on its website, which has, to all appearances, led to a manifold increase in the number of journal subscribers. As a result, the number of downloads of MUBSB papers from the publishing company website also raised by an order of magnitude from 2007 to 2013. The growing popularity of the journal is noted to have lead to its inclusion in a number of international databases, and this, in turn, has increased its attractiveness for a large number of authors, including Russian nonmembers of Moscow State University, as well as scientists from research institutes and universities of other countries. The main features of the spectrum of the papers published in MUBSB are briefly considered. © 2014, Allerton Press, Inc.",Scopus,Biological Sciences

During the past two decades, the development of sophisticated molecular technologies and instruments for biomedical research has resulted in significant advances in the biological sciences. However, the value of molecular techniques for addressing problems in marine biology has only recently begun to be cherished. It has been proven that the exploitation of molecular biological techniques will allow difficult research questions about marine organisms and ocean processes to be addressed. Marine molecular biology is a discipline, which strives to define and solve the problems regarding the sustainable exploration of marine life for human health and welfare, through the cooperation between scientists working in marine biology, molecular biology, microbiology and chemistry disciplines. Several success stories of the applications of molecular techniques in the field of marine biology are guiding further research in this area. In this review different molecular techniques are discussed, which have application in marine microbiology, marine invertebrate biology, marine ecology, marine natural products, material sciences, fisheries, conservation and bio-invasion etc. In summary, if marine biologists and molecular biologists continue to work towards strong partnership during the next decade and recognize intellectual and technological advantages and benefits of such partnership, an exciting new frontier of marine molecular biology will emerge in the future. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It is unclear, however, whether resilience can be a unifying concept consistently applied across the breadth of the biological sciences, or whether there is limited capacity for integration. In this review, we draw on literature from molecular biology to community ecology to ascertain commonalities and shortcomings in how resilience is measured and interpreted. Resilience is studied at all levels of biological organization, although the term is often not used. There is a suite of resilience mechanisms conserved across biological scales, and there are tradeoffs that affect resilience. Resilience is conceptually useful to help diverse researchers think about how biological systems respond to perturbations, but we need a richer lexicon to describe the diversity of perturbations, and we lack widely applicable metrics of resilience. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Biological Sciences

This is a bibliometric study and internationalization was examined under three main dimensions: international diffusion, collaboration and impact. The international diffusion indicators show strong preference for foreign journals and the English language. The articles were published in journals from 37 different countries and the percentage of documents published in foreign journals was 81.9%. The international collaboration indicators reveal the prevalence of co-authorship in the publication of research results. International collaboration occurred in 22.4% of articles with the collaboration of 84 countries, particularly the United States, United Kingdom Argentina, Germany and France. The international impact indicators reveal a significant set of citing documents of scientific production, primarily consisting of articles published in foreign journals in English. International citing documents accounted for 77.8% from 168 different countries, particularly from the United States, United Kingdom, China and Germany.

AI has found broad ranging applicability in technology, banking, finance, sports, entertainment, and scientific research across various disciplines. In this chapter, we give a brief overview of the application of AI in the biological sciences. Starting from the basics of machine learning we go step by step to a brief description of more advanced concepts like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with minimum mathematical detail as possible to make this article accessible to readers without formal mathematical training. Some of the AI techniques used in neuroscience, medical diagnostics, and protein structure decoding are elaborated and some examples are discussed. We also discuss some of the common pitfalls or limiting factors encountered while using AI-based algorithms in various situations. The aim of this chapter is to elucidate these concepts and incite interest among the readers on this cutting-edge domain of AI applications in the biological sciences. © The Editor(s)(if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",,Biological Sciences

This paper will include a discussion of some of the features of pre-registration education that may have influenced the manner in which biological sciences are perceived, taught and used by nurses. It will be argued that nursing may have developed a form of incomplete holism and that this may be in part responsible for the challenges that remain to be met within this area of the nursing curriculum. As a response to incomplete holism an innovative approach within pre-registration education will be introduced. This development involves the use of linked teaching sessions which aim to develop the analytical skills necessary to apply physiological knowledge to nursing practice.","Biological Sciences; Curriculum; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Holistic Nursing; Humans; Nursing Theory; Physiology; biomedicine; curriculum; education; holistic nursing; human; methodology; nursing education; nursing theory; physiology; review",Biological Sciences

Scientists from both universities have been working on a project to see if computer-assisted instruction would be useful for music education. They ran an experiment with students to see its effects. They found that it had greater effects on some types of learning than others. The paper summarizes the findings and talks about implications for future research in this field as well as practical applications for computer-assisted instruction in various fields, including education. Evaluation was based on three areas: practice, piano playing, and music appreciation. Students were divided into two groups: computer students and students without computers. The research team had expected that by using the computer, students will be able to practice longer and improve more quickly.

However, the opportunity to do research in a faculty laboratory can be limited by available resources. As a solution, national reports have called for laboratory courses that engage undergraduates in authentic research experiences. These course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have the potential to make research experiences accessible to all students. While CUREs have been reported in the literature across STEM disciplines, many of them are in the biological sciences. Here, we present two examples of large introductory biology CUREs, where students work collaboratively on research projects that have the potential to generate novel results with broader relevance. The goal of these courses is to help students develop an understanding of research in the biological sciences by engaging in authentic research experiences. We also report data from quantitative surveys and qualitative focus groups that are used to evaluate these courses and to provide continuing feedback for improvement over many implementation cycles. While the courses described in this chapter are in biological sciences, we believe that our approach is applicable to colleagues across STEM disciplines who wish to develop their own CUREs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,Biological Sciences

Design/methodology/approach: Based on interviews with 87 doctoral students in the biological sciences, this study explores how doctoral students describe development of their research skills. More specifically, a constructivist grounded theory approach is employed to understand how doctoral students make meaning of their research skill development process and how that may vary by gender and race/ethnicity. Findings: The findings reveal two emergent groups, “technicians” who focus on discrete tasks and data collection, and “interpreters” who combine technical expertise with attention to the larger scientific field. Although both groups are developing important skills, “interpreters” have a broader range of skills that support successful scholarly careers in science. Notably, white men are overrepresented among the “interpreters,” whereas white women and students from minoritized racial/ethnic groups are concentrated among the “technicians.” Originality/value: While prior literature provides valuable insights into the inequalities across various aspects of doctoral socialization, scholars have rarely attended to examining inequalities in research skill development. This study provides new insights into the process of scientific learning in graduate school. Findings reveal that research skill development is not a uniform experience, and that doctoral education fosters different kinds of learning that vary by gender and race/ethnicity. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,Biological Sciences

Therefore, in this paper, we report on how teaching, learning, and assessment were adapted to make science disciplines accessible to John, a blind student enrolled in a biological sciences degree at a research-intensive university in South Africa. Several factors contributed towards the successful completion of John's bachelor's degree. These factors include the availability of tutors who committed a large amount of time to help John understand content presented in lectures, tutorials, and practical sessions; a well-resourced and effective Disability Unit; lecturers who ensured that John was well accommodated in lectures, tutorials, and practical sessions; and, finally, John's commitment and dedication towards learning.

If value requires purpose, the refutation of natural theology after Darwin implies that humanity has no obligation to respect or preserve the natural world except insofar as it is economically efficient to do so. Drawing on the distinction between explanation and communication found in Calvinist theology, I argue that value does not entail purpose. The expressive, aesthetic, or communicative aspects of nature may be valuable or endow natural objects with value apart from any use or purpose these objects may serve. The crucial distinction between explanation and communication - one scientific, the other aesthetic - offers a rationale for an obligation to protect the natural world that may appeal to members of faith communities and to biologists and other scientists.

Most previous studies have used commercial pigs as surrogates. Method and Results In this study, we established a cloning technique for miniature pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) using Nippon Institute for Biological Science (NIBS) miniature pigs as surrogates. Moreover, utilizing this technique, we have successfully produced an α-1, 3-galactosyltransferase knockout (GalT-KO) miniature swine. Fibroblasts procured from a NIBS miniature pig fetus were injected into 1312 enucleated oocytes. The cloned embryos were transferred to 11 surrogates of which five successfully delivered 13 cloned offspring; the production efficiency was 1.0% (13/1312). In a second experiment, lung fibroblasts obtained from neonatal GalT-KO MGH miniature swine were used as donor cells and 1953 cloned embryos were transferred to 12 surrogates. Six cloned offspring were born from five surrogates, a production efficiency of 0.3% (6/1953). Conclusions These results demonstrate successful establishment of a miniature pig cloning technique by SCNT using NIBS miniature pigs as surrogates. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of successful production of GalT-KO miniature swine using miniature swine surrogates. This technique could help to ensure a stable supply of the cloned pigs through the use of miniature pig surrogates and could expand production in countries with limited space or in facilities with special regulations such as specific pathogen-free or good laboratory practice. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cloning, Organism; Embryo Transfer; Female; Galactosyltransferases; Gene Knockout Techniques; Male; Nuclear Transfer Techniques; Pregnancy; Swine; Swine, Miniature; Transplantation, Heterologous; α-1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout; embryo transfer; GalT-KO MGH miniature; miniature pigs; Nippon Institute for Biological Science miniature pigs; somatic cell nuclear transfer; alpha 1,3 galactosyltransferase; animal cell; animal experiment; article; breeding; cell nucleus transplantation; cloning; controlled study; DNA modification; embryo; embryo transfer; female; fetus; fibroblast; male; micromanipulation; minipig; nonhuman; oocyte; priority journal; somatic cell; xenotransplantation",Biological Sciences

In the present paper we provide a brief review for how the STEM today can be applied towards a range of different problems in the biological sciences, emphasizing four main areas of application. (1) For three decades, the most widely used STEM technique has been the mass determination of proteins and other macromolecular assemblies. Such measurements can be performed at low electron dose by collecting the high-angle dark-field signal using an annular detector. STEM mass mapping has proven valuable for characterizing large protein assemblies such as filamentous proteins with a well-defined mass per length. (2) The annular dark-field signal can also be used to image ultrasmall, functionalized nanoparticles of heavy atoms for labeling specific amino-acid sequences in protein assemblies. (3) By acquiring electron energy loss spectra (EELS) at each pixel in a hyperspectral image, it is possible to map the distributions of specific bound elements like phosphorus, calcium and iron in isolated macromolecular assemblies or in compartments within sectioned cells. Near single atom sensitivity is feasible provided that the specimen can tolerate a very high incident electron dose. (4) Electron tomography is a new application of STEM that enables three-dimensional reconstruction of micrometer-thick sections of cells. In this technique a probe of small convergence angle gives a large depth of field throughout the thickness of the specimen while maintaining a probe diameter of <2. nm; and the use of an on-axis bright-field detector reduces the effects of beam broadening and thus improves the spatial resolution compared to that attainable by STEM dark-field tomography. © 2012.","Biological Science Disciplines; Electron Microscope Tomography; Electrons; Humans; Macromolecular Substances; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning Transmission; Nanoparticles; Proteins; Electric impedance tomography; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Phosphorus; Probes; Proteins; Spectroscopy; Three dimensional; Transmission electron microscopy; amyloid beta protein; calcium; globular protein; heavy metal; intermediate filament protein; iron; nanoparticle; phosphorus; amyloid beta protein; protein; Cellular structure; Electron tomography; Gold Nanoparticles; Mass mapping; Scanning transmission electron microscopy; amino acid sequence; article; atom; biomedicine; electron; electron beam; electron energy loss spectroscopy; electron tomography; human; macromolecule; molecular imaging; nanoanalysis; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein assembly; protein expression; scanning transmission electron microscopy; sensitivity analysis; three dimensional imaging; cryoelectron microscopy; mass spectrometry; molecular weight; nuclear magnetic resonance; particle size; protein determination; signal detection; stoichiometry; chemistry; equipment; methodology; review; ultrastructure; Graphene",Biological Sciences

However, the ability to effectively communicate research findings is crucial for success in the biological sciences, as graduate students are encouraged to publish early and often, and professional scientists are generally evaluated by the quantity of articles published and the number of citations those articles receive. It is therefore important that undergraduate students receive a solid foundation in scientific writing early in their academic careers. In order to increase the emphasis on effective writing in the classroom, we assembled a succinct step-by-step guide to scientific writing that can be directly disseminated to undergraduates enrolled in biological science courses. The guide breaks down the scientific writing process into easily digestible pieces, providing concrete examples that students can refer to when preparing a scientific manuscript or lab report. By increasing undergraduate exposure to the scientific writing process, we hope to better prepare undergraduates for graduate school and productive careers in the biological sciences. © 2016 Turbek et al.",,Biological Sciences

The National Research Foundation of South Africa (NRF) has long used a highly structured system of ‘rating’ the past performance of individual researchers. This system relies heavily on peer review, and has seldom been benchmarked against bibliometric measures of research performance such as Hirsch’s h-index. Here I use data for about 600 rated researchers in the biological sciences to evaluate the extent to which outcomes of peer review correspond to bibliometric measures of research performance. The analysis revealed that values of the h-index based on the Scopus database are typically 5–20 for researchers placed in the NRF’s C rating category (‘established’), 20–40 for those in the B rating category (‘considerable international recognition’) and >40 for those in the A rating category (‘leading international scholars’). Despite concerns that citation patterns differ among disciplines, the mean h-index per rating category was remarkably consistent across five different disciplines in the biological sciences, namely animal sciences, plant sciences, ecology, microbiology and biochemistry/genetics. This observation suggests that the NRF rating system is equitable in the sense that the outcomes of peer review are generally consistent with bibliometric measures of research performance across different disciplines in the biological sciences. However, the study did reveal some notable discrepancies which could reflect either bias in the peer-review process or shortcomings in the bibliometric measures, or both. Significance: • NRF rating categorisations (estimates of standing in a research field based on peer review) are a reasonably good predictor of the h-index of individual researchers in the biological sciences. • The relationships between rating categorisations and the h-index are remarkably consistent across five sub-disciplines in the biological sciences. • Peer review and the h-index were compared in terms of their relative advantages and disadvantages and the combined use of both approaches is advocated for measurement of research performance. © 2020 Academy of Science of South Africa.

This shift was, and continues to be, characterized by the de-differentiation of nineteenth and early twentieth century disciplines, with increasing emphasis on the methods and authority of molecular fields. Yet we currently lack appreciation of the dynamics that underpinned these changes, and of their tangible effects on the working practices of those involved. In this article we examine the wholesale reform of biological science at the University of Manchester, England, that occurred in two successive steps in 1986 and 1993. We examine how reform was enabled by economic and political factors, as staff seized upon national pressures; in so doing, we emphasize how this reform was shaped by a generational view of the biological sciences as a one field, unified by molecular techniques. We assess how the success of these reforms was tied to new management policies that rewarded research activity in molecular fields, and refigured teaching as a punishment for research inactivity.

In this study, metadata was collected from 174 open-access, non-human biological science journals and analyzed to determine relationships between Article Processing Charges (APC), Impact Factor (IF), Eigen Factor (EF), citability, h-index, journal rank, and potential contributing factors to publishing preference, such as years of available open access, publication frequency, and average review process time. Further, the aforementioned bibliometrics were examined in relation to country of publisher, as well as their national income threshold. The results of this study provide evidence that bibliometric values such as IF, EF, citability, h-index, and journal rank all increase as APC increases, and each of these metrics are higher in publishers from high-income countries in comparison to upper-middle and lower-middle income countries.

Both fields analyze the dynamic interaction of structure and process. In East Africa's Eastern Arc Mountains, where forests contain high levels of species endemism and biological diversity, the prevailing historical paradigm from conservation science represents today's forests as surviving fragments of much larger forests. This view builds upon a century-long tradition of scientific scholarship that has developed theories for the evolution of Eastern Arc forests that encompass geological time scales. However, the relatively brief, millennialscale land-use history of the mountains, insofar as it is currently understood, suggests that human manipulation of forest biota involved periods of deforestation and regeneration, as well as the introduction of exotic plants. © 2010 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

Biology is the most gender equitable of all scientific fields by the marker of degree attainment, with 52.5% of PhDs awarded to women. However, equitable rates of degree completion do not translate into equitable attainment of faculty or postdoctoral positions, suggesting continued existence of gender inequalities. In a national cohort of 336 first-year PhD students in the biological sciences (i.e., microbiology, cellular biology, molecular biology, developmental biology, and genetics) from 53 research institutions, female participants logged significantly more research hours than males and were significantly more likely than males to attribute their work hours to the demands of their assigned projects over the course of the academic year. Despite this, males were 15% more likely to be listed as authors on published journal articles, indicating inequality in the ratio of time to credit. Given the cumulative advantage that accrues for students who publish early in their graduate careers and the central role that scholarly productivity plays in academic hiring decisions, these findings collectively point to a major potential source of persisting underrepresentation of women on university faculties in these fields. © 2017 D.

However, medicine successfully recruits and retains women physicians, despite being less family friendly than biology in terms of workload, stress, and inflexible work hours. Both professions are competitive but at different times in a person's career. Competition for entry into medical school is intense, but this period of competition occurs prior to family formation for most women. For women biologists, the most intense period of competition occurs during the search for faculty positions. Many women have partners or children at this time.

On the one hand, the department can claim a research legacy inherited directly from Sir Stamford Raffles. On the other hand, our academic traditions originate with Singapore as a Crown Colony, through to its founding as a Republic, and the establishment of the National University of Singapore. During its brief 67-year history, Biological Sciences has kept a forward looking direction in education and research. This chapter will tell the story of the department in three parts, its constant reinvention into the department today and the people who led it, the development of the curriculum and its education mission, and finally the transformation into a research-intensive department through its Museums, Institutes, Centers, and Core Facilities. © 2017 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

In fact, the pervasiveness of Shannon’s information theory—as well as of the very terms themselves—becomes evident when one takes a moment to reflect upon just a few of the concepts that are standard in the biomedical sciences, such as genetic code, messenger RNA, ion channel, cell signaling, intracellular communication, signal transduction, pathogen transmission, positive feedback loop, expressive noise minimization, and many others. In this chapter we first give a historical introduction concerning the concept and nature of information, with a special emphasis upon the biological sciences. Then, we provide a few important examples of information at work in the biological sciences. Next, we consider the debate regarding the reality and nature of bioinformation, arguing that bioinformation is best understood as a relationship between and/or among entities; for instance, DNA is informational only in relation to a given cellular context, and it is misguiding to locate information in a particular molecule. We then go on to show how bioinformation relates to other concepts such as entropy, order, organization, complexity, and knowledge. Finally, we approach education itself as an informational process in order to draw some consequences for the teaching of biology. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,Biological Sciences

A grassroots movement is emerging within the biological sciences to give new scientific and/or common names to species that bear harmful eponyms. Approaches to renaming species include updating terminology planning processes, using more diverse and inclusive eponyms, re-instating pre-colonial names, and replacing eponyms with transparent terms. Many of these activities are in collaboration with Indigenous communities, as well as with other types of experts and the broader public.

This paper explores the situation further by comparing student perceptions with those of experienced practitioners (Part One of the study) and also evaluates the confidence of staff nurses in explaining the rationale for care applied to a common but specific disorder (influenza; Part Two). Questionnaires were used. Responses were elicited from DipHE Nursing (Project 2000) adult/child branch students (n = 153) from two universities and from adult/child care staff from their local clinical placements (n = 171 in Part One of study; n = 266 in Part Two). The questions asked followed two themes: (1) confidence in understanding biological science and (2) issues of teaching and learning. Most questions utilized a rating scale from 1 to 10; this scale provides no central value and a vertical line was drawn to encourage respondents to identify which half of the scale their responses came under (basically, a negative or positive viewpoint). The significance of the data distribution either side of the midline was analysed statistically (simple sign test), as were any differences in distribution between the groups (chi-square test). Median values were also determined. The data do not provide support for views that the biosciences are being significantly diminished by modern curricula, but also show no evidence for a great improvement in the bioscience knowledge base in recent years. What was surprising was the lack of confidence expressed by staff nurses: one illuminating finding was the lack of confidence in articulating their knowledge to patients and, even less so, to other health professionals. The paper reiterates a need for a national teaching and learning strategy for pre- and postregistration education in the biosciences. In particular, a means to raise the level of understanding of staff nurses must be identified urgently so that the mentoring of students in these subjects is improved.","Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Biological Sciences; Child; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Education, Nursing; Great Britain; Humans; Influenza, Human; Nursing Staff; Statistics, Nonparametric; Students, Nursing; adult; article; biomedicine; child; clinical competence; clinical trial; curriculum; education; health personnel attitude; human; influenza; methodology; multicenter study; nonparametric test; nursing; nursing education; nursing staff; nursing student; pathophysiology; United Kingdom",Biological Sciences

Typically, students “live” from exam to exam only preparing and studying for the exam directly ahead of them while neglecting concurrent courses. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the impact of weekly multicourse collective exams academic behaviors and learning in an integrated biological sciences (BSI) course within a PharmD program. Weekly multicourse exams included questions, four per credit hour, from all first semester courses that traditionally included summative exams. Seven courses contributed questions, which amounted to 15 weekly exams of —60 questions. No other graded assessments were given in any of the courses, other than individual course cumulative final exams; the final exams in each course were not collective. After completion of final exams, a Qualtrics survey was emailed to all students and the two professors teaching the course. Course grades, not including the final exam, were compared between two cohorts with or without the collective exams to determine impact on learning. The cumulative final exam was compared between cohorts to determine impact on retention. The majority of students agreed or strongly agreed that the weekly collective exams encouraged them to study BSI more frequently, most days of the week, reduced the likelihood of skipping class, and increased likelihood to pay attention and engage in class. The majority believed that they better learned and retained the BSI material. The majority specified that they liked the collective exams for BSI and preferred it over a traditional exam schedule. Learning also appeared to be improved. However, the impact on retention is less clear and requires further research. In conclusion, the weekly multicourse collective exams improved academic behaviors and learning. © 2021. the American Physiological Society.

In particular approaches which can handle data from unspecified distributions and nonlinear models are of interest. We propose an algebra-based computational framework to unify experimental design and model selection for discrete data sets and minimal polynomial models. We use an affine transformation, called a linear shift, to identify data sets and bases of polynomial models simultaneously. We present the theoretical foundation for a web-accessible database. This framework enables us to address two illustrative questions that may arise when studying biological systems: finding the data which identifies a set of known interactions and finding identifiable interactions given a set of data. As an example, we apply the methodology to a previously constructed pharmacodynamic model of epidermal derived growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. © 2021 The Author(s)",Computational efficiency; Data Science; Design of experiments; Linear transformations; Metadata; Algebraic models; Biological data; Biological data science; Data set; Distribution models; Finite fields; Gröbne base; Model Selection; Polynomial models; Standard monomial; Statistics,Biological Sciences

Six examples are used to introduce and discuss the subject: Medical implants in the human body, biosensors and biochips for diagnostics, tissue engineering, bioelectronics, artificial photosynthesis, and biomimetic materials. They are areas of varying maturity, together constituting a strong driving force for the current rapid development of BioSS. The second driving force is the purely scientific challenges and opportunities to explore the mutual interaction between biological components and surfaces. Model systems range from the unique water structures at solid surfaces and water shells around proteins and biomembranes, via amino and nucleic acids, proteins, DNA, phospholipid membranes, to cells and living tissue at surfaces. At one end of the spectrum the scientific challenge is to map out the structures, bonding, dynamics and kinetics of biomolecules at surfaces in a similar way as has been done for simple molecules during the past three decades in surface science. At the other end of the complexity spectrum one addresses how biofunctional surfaces participate in and can be designed to constructively participate in the total communication system of cells and tissue. Biofunctional surfaces call for advanced design and preparation in order to match the sophisticated (bio) recognition ability of biological systems. Specifically this requires combined topographic, chemical and visco-elastic patterns on surfaces to match proteins at the nm scale and cells at the micrometer scale. Essentially all methods of surface science are useful. High-resolution (e.g. scanning probe) microscopies, spatially resolved and high sensitivity, non-invasive optical spectroscopies, self-organizing monolayers, and nano- and microfabrication are important for BioSS. However, there is also a need to adopt or develop new methods for studies of biointerfaces in the native, liquid state. For the future it is likely that BioSS will have an even broader definition than above and include native interfaces, and that combinations of molecular (cell) biology and BioSS will contribute to the understanding of the ""living state"". © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is an ethical dilemma since it is about promoting good in the context of the potential for also causing harm, e.g., the promotion of health in the context of providing the wherewithal for the killing of innocents. It is an ethical dilemma for the researcher because of the potential actions of others, e.g., malevolent non-researchers who might steal dangerous biological agents, or make use of the original researcher's work. And it is a dilemma for governments concerned with the security of their citizens, as well as their health. In this article we construct a taxonomy of types of ""experiments of concern"" in the biological sciences, and thereby map the terrain of ethical risk. We then provide a series of analyses of the ethical problems and considerations at issue in the dual-use dilemma, including the impermissibility of certain kinds of research and possible restrictions on dissemination of research results given the risks to health and security. Finally, we explore the main available institutional responses to some of the specific ethical problems posed by the dual-use dilemma in the biological sciences. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Biological Warfare; Biomedical Research; Genetic Engineering; Human Experimentation; Humans; Philosophy; Security Measures; United States; article; biological warfare; ethics; genetic engineering; human; human experiment; legal aspect; medical research; organization and management; philosophy; United States,Biological Sciences

Our experience shows that inquiry-based hands-on exercises provide the most efficient approach to bioinformatic straining. In this article, we report a structural bioinformatics project carried out by Master degree students to determine structure–function relationships of the uncharacterized prokaryotic 5-oxoprolinase subunit A (PxpA). PxpA associates with the PxpBC complex to form a functional 5-oxoprolinase enzyme for conversion of 5-oxoproline to L-glutamate. Although the exact role of PxpA is yet to be determined, it has been demonstrated that PxpBC catalyses the first step of the reaction, which is phosphorylation of 5-oxoproline. Here, we provide evidence that PxpA is involved in the last two steps of the reaction:decyclization of the labile phosphorylated 5-oxoproline to the equally labile γ-glutamylphosphate, and subsequent dephosphorylation to L-glutamate. Structural bioinformatics analysis of four putative PxpA structures revealed that PxpA adopts a non-canonical TIM barrel fold with well-characterized TIM barrel enzyme features. These include a C-terminal groove comprising potentially essential conserved amino acid residues organized into putative motifs. Phylogenetic analysis suggests a relationship between taxonomic grouping and PxpA oligomerization. PxpA forms a tunnel upon ligand binding, thus suggesting that the PxpABC complex employs the mechanism of substrate channeling to protect labile intermediates. Ultimately, students were able to form a testable hypothesis on the function of PxpA, an achievement we consider encouraging other students to emulate. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(6):620–631, 2019. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","Biological Science Disciplines; Computational Biology; Curriculum; Glutamic Acid; Humans; Models, Molecular; Pyroglutamate Hydrolase; Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid; Structure-Activity Relationship; Students; 5 oxoprolinase; glutamic acid; pyroglutamic acid; biology; biomedicine; chemistry; curriculum; education; human; metabolism; molecular model; structure activity relation; student",Biological Sciences

Methods: Exploratory study with 827 alumni of doctoral programs in public health, biological and health sciences at the Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, RJ, Southeastern Brazil, from1984 to 2007. The subjects were grouped in three cross-temporal cohorts according to year. The profiles of the alumni were analyzed, their career paths mapped and information on the perceptions of the education they received and the reasons that led them to choose the institute for their doctoral courses gathered, as well as their evaluations of the courses. The data were collected by means of an online questionnaire. Results: There are differences between cohorts of alumni related to the periods they followed the courses, their distinct educational backgrounds and labor processes between those from the biological and health sciences areas, and to the specificities of the different areas where the institution offers doctoral courses: public health, biological and health sciences. Conclusions: The results allow the academic management of the educational processes to expend its knowledge, thus establishing a baseline for tracking the trajectory of alumni, and may contribute to upgrading the follow up process of Brazilian graduate programs.","Achievement; Adult; Biological Science Disciplines; Brazil; Career Mobility; Cohort Studies; Education, Graduate; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Questionnaires; academic achievement; achievement; adult; article; biomedicine; Brazil; career mobility; cohort analysis; female; human; male; middle aged; questionnaire; satisfaction",Biological Sciences

In particular, the wider stakeholders, particularly health service users, are rarely consulted on the knowledge base expected of practitioners. We report here on an evaluation, involving students, lecturers, nurses and service users, aimed at reviewing the bioscience component of the preregistration mental health nursing course. Students and lecturers agreed that the current common foundation course in bioscience was biased towards the adult branch students, and failed to meet the needs of mental health nurses. The mental health lecturers' solution to the 'bioscience problem' was to curtail the input. In contrast, service users described serious shortfalls in professionals' abilities to inform them of common side-effects of medication; these problems were attributable to inadequate educational preparation. The knowledge deficits identified could be rectified by making pharmacology an important part of the mental health education programme. However, for the curriculum to accom-modate applied pharmacology, its supporting bioscience, and essential preparation in psychosocial interventions, some restructuring of the biological science programme for mental health nurses will be necessary. Our findings suggest that such restructuring should be informed by service users' views of their needs.","Attitude of Health Personnel; Attitude to Health; Biological Sciences; Clinical Competence; Community Health Nursing; Curriculum; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Faculty, Nursing; Focus Groups; Humans; Needs Assessment; Nursing Education Research; Nursing Staff; Organizational Innovation; Pharmacology; Program Evaluation; Psychiatric Nursing; Questionnaires; Students, Nursing; article; attitude to health; biomedicine; clinical competence; community health nursing; curriculum; education; evaluation; health care quality; health personnel attitude; human; information processing; needs assessment; nursing education; nursing staff; nursing student; organization; organization and management; pharmacology; psychiatric nursing; psychological aspect; questionnaire; standard",Biological Sciences

Results illuminated a complex array of factors that students considered in selecting a PI, including PI relationship, mentoring style, and professional stability. Further, with regard to students’ lab selection, peers and research projects played an important role. Students actively conceptualized trade-offs among various dimensions of fit. Our findings also revealed cases in which students did not secure a position in their first (or second) choice labs and had to consider their potential fit with suboptimal placements (in terms of their initial assessments). Thus, these students weighted different factors of fit against the reality of needing to secure financial support to continue in their doctoral programs.

It is a frequent and widespread habit in all societies and does not distinguish between sex and age. Therefore, students are not exempt from using this practice. Aims: To carry out a systematic review of scientific articles published between 2010 and 2020 on self-medication in university students of careers related to medical and biological sciences with PRISMA guidelines. Methods: A standardized search was performed in four databases with the following terms: Automedicación (in Spanish), Self-medication, Automedication, University Student, and Students. For the selection of studies, the Rayyan® tool was used. The most relevant information on self-medication of university students was collected. Results: Fourteen articles were included and evaluated as high, medium, and low quality with the AXIS tool. The results of the study reflected a high self-medication in university students of careers related to medical and biological sciences, with a higher prevalence of self-medication in women than in men. The more knowledge these students have, the greater their self-medication and, thus, they always maintain this practice, being the most indicated causes for it the problems in the respiratory tract, headaches, and gastrointestinal problems. The main reasons for these students to practice self-medication are the knowledge they have acquired in their curricula, due to past experiences with the same symptoms and minor illnesses. Pharmacies, through friends, relatives or neighbors and home medicine cabinets are the most common places for the acquisition of medications by these students, indicating that analgesics/antiinflammatories, antibiotics, and antipyretics are the most used medications among them. Conclusions: These students practice self-medication because they consider they have sufficient knowledge about diseases and their treatments, which gives them more confidence in making the decision to self-medicate.

Design/methodology/approach: Within the socialization framework, this study uses a qualitative approach whereby 42 biological sciences students enrolled at highly selective US universities were interviewed in the first and second year of doctoral training about laboratory rotation experiences. Findings: The study revealed how doctoral students used formal and informal information networks, explored research topics, struggled with funding concerns and learned about the social aspect of the laboratories in which they rotated. Originality/value: While rotations are considered a signature pedagogy in the laboratory sciences, students’ experiences within them are understudied. This study offers new knowledge about what doctoral students experience while rotating that can be used to inform and improve rotation processes for both students and universities. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,Biological Sciences

This article describes the design of a yearlong, stand-alone laboratory course-the Biotechniques Laboratory-a common core course in the second year of all our degree programs in the biological sciences. It is an enabling, introductory laboratory course with a focus on the development of basic, practical skills, competencies, and knowledge in experimental techniques commonly used across the biological sciences. It is based on a full ""hands on"" approach where all students undertake a variety of practical exercises derived principally from the disciplines of biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and microbiology. Explicit skills training, the opportunity to repeat laboratory exercises until the required skill and/or competency is achieved, the consolidation of learned skills in different contexts throughout the course and a competency based assessment method are all distinctive features that facilitate the achievement of the desired student outcomes. Students graduate from this course enabled to more effectively engage and achieve in advanced laboratory courses and research projects developing higher order skills and knowledge for use in graduate studies and/or employment. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.",,Biological Sciences

Both critics and defenders of AN have tended to focus on the thorny issues that are specific to human beings. But some philosophers claim that AN faces other difficulties, arguing that its broader conception of natural normativity is incompatible with current biological science. This paper has three aims. First, we consider a distinctive and nuanced critique of AN’s general understanding of natural normativity put forward by Tim Lewens. Second, after giving a defense of AN, we explore and evaluate Lewens’ proposed alternative view—Kantian projectivism about life forms. We present a problem for Kantian projectivism and suggest reasons for thinking that AN is, after all, the superior position. Finally, we clarify and explain how AN’s claims about life forms and our knowledge of them, relate to empirical observation and to contemporary biological science. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Biological Sciences

Student needs were measured through a needs assessment methodology scheme that included a content analysis of peer-reviewed journals, a nationwide cross-sectional survey, and semi-structured interviews. The research question that guided the study was: what are the mathematical needs of biological sciences undergraduate students as perceived by certain stakeholder groups? The stakeholder groups represented the areas of ecology, evolution, and behaviour, and developmental biology to portray two extremes in the use of mathematics. Major findings included: (1) The use of mathematics to support experimental design is the most consistent need across disciplines. (2) An overall understanding of mathematical models is needed as a minimum for scientific literacy. (3) Evolution and animal behaviour students need descriptive and inferential statistics, stochastic processes, differential equations, and mathematical models in general. Developmental biology students, on the other hand, need only descriptive and inferential statistics, and mathematical models. These needs, however, strongly vary depending on students’ career tracks within their subdisciplines, suggesting the necessity of a flexible undergraduate curriculum. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,Biological Sciences

Furthermore, current practices in science outreach remain largely based on ineffective communication models that may undermine public trust and interest. I argue that, in trying to improve both participation rates and the effectiveness of science outreach, we must take a more scientific approach, and we must practice outreach with the same rigor as the science that we share with the public. Here, I describe common misconceptions that can undermine the value of science communication with the public at many scales. I then describe an evidence-based, iterative, evaluative framework for biologists at all career stages to pursue public engagement in the biological sciences.

Study Design: Cross Sectional study Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted at the Sohail University from April 2021 to June 2021 for a period of 02 months. Materials and Methods: The study participants included 100 Physical therapies and 94 Biotechnology & Biological sciences students. A questionnaire was distributed to each student. The questionnaire included 17 items regarding online and traditional teaching. The students were asked to select a response for each item on the questionnaire including the preferred teaching method from zoom online, traditional, or both. The data were presented in terms of percentage for the individual items, preference in theory, and the overall preferred teaching method. Results: The students gave the opinion that the presence of teacher (82.1%), asking the queries to the teacher (80.2%), giving feedback to the teacher (78.3%), and interest in learning (76.4%) were more important aspects for traditional teaching. Regarding the zoom online lectures, accessibility to the internet hindered online teaching (84%) and online teaching led to more distraction (67.9%). Moreover, a high majority of students (79.2%) preferred the traditional method for theory. The overall preference for the traditional method (83%) was higher as compared to online (2.8%) and both methods (14.2%). Conclusion: The majority of physical therapy and Biotechnology & Biological sciences students had a preference for traditional teaching methods in Physiology. © 2021 Medical Forum Monthly.

The authors address the following questions: How do biological science graduate students navigate career indecision? And how does agency relate to their experiences with career indecision? Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyzed interview data collected from 84 PhD biology graduate students. Researchers used a grounded theory approach. After open codes were developed and data were coded, code reports were generated, which were used to determine themes. Findings: More than half of the sample had not committed to a career path, and undecided students were bifurcated into two categories: Uncommitted and Uncertain. Uncommitted graduate students demonstrated agency in their approach and were focused on exploration and development. Uncertain students demonstrated less agency, were more fearful and perceived less control and clarity about their options and strategies to pursue career goals. Practical implications: Findings suggest some forms of indecision can be productive and offer institutional leaders guidance for increasing the efficacy of career development and exploration programming. Originality/value: Research on doctoral student career decision-making is often quantitative and rarely explores the role of agency. This qualitative study focuses on the relationship between student agency and career indecision, which is an understudied aspect of career development. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,Biological Sciences

This applies equally to scientific talks, posters, and published articles; thus, scientific English must be prioritized in nonnative English-speaking (NNES) academic institutions to prepare their trainees for successful careers. Here, we propose strategies for integrating scientific English into PhD programs operating in NNES countries. Many graduate students from NNES countries strive for an international career and encounter English as an important barrier. Based on our own experiences as NNES postdoctoral fellows at a US institution, or as a US mentor of these trainees, we contend that conventional learning processes at home institutions do not sufficiently prioritize scientific English as the medium for regular discussions of laboratory-generated data. Principal investigators, mentors, and supervisors are key in promoting English language usage as a structured component of PhD training. If these stakeholders routinely integrate English training and education within the research laboratory program, graduates will be equipped to pursue international academic careers. The ideas presented here are intended for NNES PhD students (and their mentors) who seek an international scientific career in the biological sciences. © 2019 Camila H.

However, in the recent and not so recent past, a number of governments have sought to develop biological weapons, e.g. the large-scale biological weapons program in the Soviet Union from 1946 to 1992. Moreover, there have been a number of acts, or attempted acts, of bioterrorism, notably by the Aum Shinrikyo in Japan. Techniques of genetic engineering have been available for some time to enhance the virulence, transmissibility and so on of naturally occurring pathogens. Recent developments in synthetic genomics have exacerbated the problem even further. Accordingly, there is the very real possibility of malevolent individuals or groups acquiring pathogens that have enhanced virulence and transmissibility and releasing them into the environment with catastrophic consequence. Some obvious regulatory measures that might be considered in relation to dual use issues include: regulations providing for mandatory physical safety and security of the storage, transport and physical access to samples of pathogens, equipment, laboratories etc.; mandatory licensing of dual-use technologies/techniques/pathogen samples; mandatory education and training; mandatory personnel security regulation e.g. background checks; censorship. © 2018, The Author(s).",,Biological Sciences

To accomplish this objective, the CBDP must maintain robust science and technology capabilities to support the research, development, testing, and evaluation required for the creation and validation of the products the program supplies. The threat from chemical and biological attack evolves due to the changing nature of conflict and rapid advances in science and technology (S&T), so the core S&T capabilities that must be maintained by the CBDP must also continue to evolve. In order to address the challenges facing the DoD, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) asked the National Research Council (NRC) to conduct a study to identify the core capabilities in S&T that must be supported by the program. The NRC Committee on Determining Core Capabilities in Chemical and Biological Defense Research and Development examined the capabilities necessary for the chemical and biological defense S&T program in the context of the threat and of the program's stated mission and priorities. Determining Core Capabilities in Chemical and Biological Defense Science and Technology contains the committee's findings and recommendations.

This SEA requires each student to choose a topic among a long list of topics and interact with it in any way to produce a finished product without the interference of the course instructor. Students are told that the SEA will be graded based on their commitment, creative thinking, innovation in developing the idea, and finishing up of the chosen assignment. The SEA has been implemented in three introductory courses, namely, Biology, Introduction to Human Nutrition and Food Science, and The Human Body. Many interesting projects resulted from the SEA, and, based on an administered survey, students assessed this assignment very favorably.

Health science professionals need information for conducting their activities related to human care, academic and research pursuits, thus providing library and information support to the health professionals has gained importance. Different health science information systems are associated with health-related institutions like medical colleges, hospitals etc. For managing these information systems on professional and scientific lines, library professionals play an important role. Realising the importance of LIS professionals in health sector, departments of library and information science have introduced different specialised papers. Health science information system is one such specialisation introduced in the library and information science discipline with the aim to produce competent professionals with sufficient skills, knowledge and attitude for managing the libraries and information systems in the health sector. The different components of the curriculum of health science information system is the focus of the present paper.

Indeed, developing and improving the health information skill set of health sciences students is required in order for students to effectively locate, critically evaluate, and efficiently use online health information for the effective location, critical evaluation and efficient use of online health information. This paper undertakes a systematic review of the literature with a focus on electronic health information literacy skills with the aim of identifying the current trends, contributions to, and practices in health sciences students' education, and informing researchers in the field universally about the essential baseline for the design and development of effective course contents, pedagogy and assessment approaches.

To increase such diversity, programs must facilitate youth interest in pursuing a health science-related career (HSRC). Minority youth from low socioeconomic families may focus on the secondary gains of careers, such as high income and status, given their low socioeconomic backgrounds. On the other hand, self-determination theory suggests that it is the intrinsic characteristics of careers which are most likely to sustain pursuit of an HSRC and lead to job satisfaction. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for pursuing an HSRC (defined in this study as health professional, health scientist, and medical doctor) was examined in a cohort of youth from the 10th to 12th grade from 2011 to 2013. The sample was from low-income area high schools, had a B- or above grade point average at baseline, and was predominantly: African American (65.7 %) or Hispanic (22.9 %), female (70.1 %), and children of foreign-born parents (64.7 %). In longitudinal general estimating equations, intrinsic motivation (but not extrinsic motivation) consistently predicted intention to pursue an HSRC. This finding provides guidance as to which youth and which qualities of HSRCs might deserve particular attention in efforts to increase diversity in the health science-related workforce. © 2015, The New York Academy of Medicine.",Adolescent; African Americans; Career Choice; Female; Health Manpower; Health Occupations; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Male; Minority Groups; Motivation; Parents; Physicians; Poverty; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; adolescent; African American; decision making; female; health care manpower; Hispanic; human; male; medical profession; minority group; motivation; parent; physician; poverty; psychology; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; United States,Health Sciences

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among health science and non-health science students from the University of Thessaly, Greece. The 14 item - Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) was used to measure students' health anxiety. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to test the hypothesis. Results: The population sample consisted of 562 health science students and 204 agriculture and computer science students. The prevalence of health anxiety (SHAI score >14) was 18.1% (95% CI 15.4%-21.1%) while 8.3% (95% CI 6.4%-10.5%) of the participants suffered from clinical health anxiety (SHAI score >18). Health science students had higher SHAI scores compared to non-health science students. Multivariable analysis revealed an increased risk for health anxiety in health science students (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.02-3.97, p=0.044). Health anxiety was also associated with sex (female) (p<0,008) and the presence of health anxiety in a family member (p<0,001). Conclusion: The current study identified studying health sciences as a determinant of health anxiety in students of a Greek university, after considering several confounding factors. This relatively neglected hypothesis should be further examined, preferably in a prospective cohort design. © 2021 Androniki Papadopoulou, Michalis Koureas, Alexandros Farmakis, Argyro Sirakouli, Ioanna V.

Methods: This narrative review involved retrieving citations from several subject databases, including Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts; Information Science & Technology Abstracts; Library & Information Science Source; PubMed; and CINAHL. The author limited her review to those publications that explicitly addressed the use of humor in relation to some form of academic library or health sciences instruction. Studies examining use of humor in patient education were excluded. Results: Scholars and practitioners have consistently written about humor as an instructional strategy from the 1980s onward, in both the library literature and health sciences literature. These authors have focused on instructors’ attitudes, benefits to students, anecdotes, and best practices summaries. Overall, both librarians and health sciences educators have a positive opinion of humor, and many instructors make use of it in their classrooms, though caution and careful planning is advised. Conclusions: Commonalities between the library and information science literature and health sciences literature provide a cohesive set of best practices and strategies for successfully incorporating comedy into library instruction sessions.

At present, interest in researching health information needs and reliable sources paradigms has gained momentum in many countries. However, most studies focus on health professionals and students in higher education institutions. Objective The present study was aimed at providing new insight and filling the existing gap by examining health information needs and reliability of sources among nondegree health sciences students in Tanzania. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted in 15 conveniently selected health training institutions, where 403 health sciences students were participated. Thirty health sciences students were both purposely and conveniently chosen from each health-training institution. The selected students were pursuing nursing and midwifery, clinical medicine, dentistry, environmental health sciences, pharmacy, and medical laboratory sciences courses. Involved students were either in their first year, second year, or third year of study. Results Health sciences students' health information needs focus on their educational requirements, clinical practice, and personal information. They use print, human, and electronic health information. They lack eHealth research skills in navigating health information resources and have insufficient facilities for accessing eHealth information, a lack of specialists in health information, high costs for subscription electronic information, and unawareness of the availability of free Internet and other online health-related databases. Conclusion This study found that nondegree health sciences students have limited skills in EHIL. Thus, designing and incorporating EHIL skills programs into the curriculum of nondegree health sciences students is vital. EHIL is a requirement common to all health settings, learning environments, and levels of study. Our future intention is to design EHIL to support nondegree health sciences students to retrieve and use available health information resources on the Internet. © 2017 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai","Computer Literacy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Information Seeking Behavior; Internet; Students, Health Occupations; Tanzania; Telemedicine; clinical medicine; clinical practice; cross-sectional study; curriculum; data base; dentistry; environmental health; health science; human; information seeking; Internet; learning environment; literacy; major clinical study; medical information; medical technology; midwife; nursing; pharmacy; reliability; student; Tanzania; telehealth; health student; human computer interaction; information seeking; Internet; telemedicine",Health Sciences

Moreover, health science students are the future leaders and advocates of vaccination efforts. Therefore, it is essential to understand the origins of vaccine hesitancy and evaluate if the adverse psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic influence it. (2) Methods: we shared an anonymous questionnaire among health-science students via institutional emails of two Lithuanian universities. Results were summarized with odds ratios and mean differences. (3) Results: a total of 1545 health sciences students answered the questionnaire. Almost a fifth of the respondents claimed that they were unsure about getting vaccinated, and nearly one out of ten claimed that they would not get vaccinated. Medicine students, non-infected students, and students who volunteered in a COVID-19 ward were significantly more willing to get vaccinated compared to other health science students. Vaccine hesitant respondents reported a more significant negative effect of COVID-19 on their income and belief in the future.

More knowledge is needed on the levels of generic competencies that health sciences experts possess, particularly in the context of complex decision-making. Objectives: To describe self-evaluated generic competence of health sciences students and its associated factors. Design: A cross-sectional observational study design. Participants: A total of 291 health science students in five universities in Finland participated in this study during the spring of 2022. Methods: The data was collected by using the HealthGenericCom instrument with 88 items and 8 sum dimensions using a five-point Likert scale (1—poor to 5—excellent): 1) competence in leadership, administration, and finance; 2) people-centred guiding competence; 3) competence of health promotion; 4) competence of evidence-based practice; 5) digital competence; 6) competence in work well-being and self-management; 7) competence in collaboration and problem-solving, and 8) competence in societal interaction. The K-means cluster algorithm was used to classify generic competence profiles to identify the profiles of health sciences students. Results: Four generic health sciences competence profiles (A = 18 %, B = 23 %, C = 33 %, D = 26 %) were identified. Profile A demonstrated the lowest level of most generic competencies in health sciences. Digital competence was shown to be at the lowest level among the participants, whereas competence in collaboration, problem-solving, and health promotion was evaluated as the highest competence level. The students evaluated their competence as being higher when they were older, were currently engaged in master's degree programmes, had completed work-based practical training in social and health care, and had varied work experiences or held leading positions. Conclusions: Students need to improve their generic competencies in health sciences, with a particular focus on developing their digital competence. More focus should be given to work-based practical training. © 2023 The Authors","Clinical Competence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Finland; Health Promotion; Humans; Students; Students, Nursing; clinical competence; cross-sectional study; Finland; health care delivery; health promotion; human; nursing student; student",Health Sciences

However, these interventions only serve to mitigate exposures and prevent disease if they are effectively disseminated, adopted, implemented, and sustained. Main body: Numerous studies have documented the enormous time lag between research and practice, noting that dissemination and implementation are not passive processes but rely on active and intentional strategies. Implementation science seeks to build the knowledge base for understanding strategies to effectively disseminate and implement evidence and evidence-based interventions, and thus, bridge the research-to-practice gap. Conclusion: Environmental health researchers are well positioned to advance health promotion and disease prevention by incorporating implementation science into their work.

Methods: The data was collected by using individual semi-structured interviews during the spring of 2021. The data was analyzed using content analysis. Results: The health sciences students felt that their expertise encompasses motivation for future career development, understanding the social and professional influences on their career development, versatile expertise in various aspects of health sciences, and developing competence in different learning environments. The students recognized that digital learning requires the active participation, digitalization is a part of a successful learning environment, and digital learning challenges social interactions.

In this article the two questions are posed: 1. as to which structural problems characterize research into health and illness today and 2. how far can the establishment of an interdisciplinary sphere of 'health sciences' provide adequate solutions? The authors also sketch the outlines of the new health sciences as an intergrating and 'trans-paradigmatical' teaching and research field and they consider the relationships of health sciences to practice in general, and their relevance to the health services in particular. The challenges in the future for public health and therefore for the health sciences will be enormous. A breakthrough in this field will probably not be achieved until the research interests or clinical specialists and researchers oriented towards social and behavioural sciences are linked over a broad front.

A broader impact of health sciences librarianship is its advocacy for improvements in public health. In recent years, health science librarians have been actively involved in advocating for adequate, responsive, and culturally competent health care for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals. Health sciences librarians have advocated for LGBTQ+ individuals through a variety of specialized outreach projects to address health disparities found in the LGBTQ+ community such as HIV/ AIDS, women’s health, or substance abuse, have collaborated with public health agencies and community-based organizations to identify health disparities and needs, and have implemented outreach to address these needs. This chapter maps the landscape of health sciences librarian outreach to LGBTQ+ people. The authors develop this theme through case studies of health science librarians providing health information to the LGBTQ+ community and healthcare professionals. Following an overview of advocacy for LGBTQ+ health by the US National Network of Libraries of Medicine and professional information organizations, they conclude the chapter by discussing the “pio-neering” nature of these projects and the common threads uniting them, and by identifying the next steps for continued successful outreach through the development of an evidence base and tailoring of outreach and resources to address other demographic aspects of the members of the LGBTQ+ community. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.",,Health Sciences

The aim of this study was to compare the factors influencing conceptions of learning in health sciences and non-health sciences students enrolled in postgraduate master programs in order to obtain information that may be useful for students and for future postgraduate programs. Methods: A modified version of the Learning Inventory Conception Questionnaire (COLI) was used to compare students' conception learning factors in 131 students at the beginning of their postgraduate studies in health sciences, experimental sciences, arts and humanities and social sciences. Results: The present study demonstrates that a set of factors may influence conception of learning of health sciences postgraduate students, with learning as gaining information, remembering, using, and understanding information, awareness of duty and social commitment being the most relevant. For these students, learning as a personal change, a process not bound by time or place or even as acquisition of professional competences, are less relevant. According to our results, this profile is not affected by gender differences. Conclusions: Our results show that the overall conceptions of learning differ among students of health sciences and non-health sciences (experimental sciences, arts and humanities and social sciences) master postgraduate programs. These finding are potentially useful to foster the learning process of HS students, because if they are metacognitively aware of their own conception or learning, they will be much better equipped to self-regulate their learning behavior in a postgraduate master program in health sciences. © 2018 The Author(s).","Adult; Analysis of Variance; Education, Professional; Female; Humanities; Humans; Learning; Male; Professional Competence; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Factors; Social Sciences; Spain; Students; Students, Health Occupations; Surveys and Questionnaires; article; awareness; comparative study; conception; controlled study; female; health science; human; human experiment; humanities; learning; major clinical study; male; memory; postgraduate student; professional competence; questionnaire; sex difference; sociology; adult; analysis of variance; comparative study; education; health student; psychology; reproducibility; sex factor; Spain; student; vocational education",Health Sciences

Each site was given the tasks of development, evaluation, integration, and promotion of pain management curriculum resources, including case studies that will be shared nationally. Collaborations among schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, and others were encouraged. The John D.

This paper describes a blueprint of pain content and teaching methods across the University of Washington's 6 health sciences schools and provides recommendations for improvement in pain education at the prelicensure level. The Schools of Dentistry and Physician Assistant provide the highest percentage of total required curriculum hours devoted to pain compared with the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Social Work. The findings confirm the paucity of pain content in health sciences curricula, missing International Association for the Study of Pain curriculum topics, and limited use of innovative teaching methods such as problem-based and team-based learning.

Literature demonstrates that we have yet to reach any form of consensus about which indicators are needed to assess and teach quality health sciences and medical education through technology or innovation. There is, therefore, a greater need for a tool or platform that is properly constructed, validated and tested within health sciences. Methods: This paper presents a study, which is part of a larger research project assessing staff and students’ perceptions of the importance and relevance of different aspects of e-Learning and mHealth in health sciences curricula at four universities in South Africa. The specific objectives of this study were to: (i) assess health sciences staffs’ perceptions and understanding of these two applications; and (ii) establish challenges and opportunities of e-Learning and mHealth applications in the health sector, as well as perceptions on the importance and relevance of these applications to their curricula and future practices. A combination of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and a key-informant interview was used. A total of 19 staff from four universities participated. Atlast.ti was used for the data analysis and the findings were coded using a primarily deductive thematic coding framework. Results: The findings revealed that not all staff members are equipped or trained with new applications or technologies, such as mHealth. Most participants believed that diverse technologies and tools could be integrated with mHealth and e-Learning. Furthermore, participants agree that a new multi-modal platform, in the form of a learning management system (LMS) with relevant applications (and possible plugins) integrated, tailored towards health sciences will benefit all stakeholders, and be valuable to higher education and health sectors. Conclusions: Digitalisation as well as digital citizenship is gradually being integrated into teaching and learning. It is imperative to adapt the health sciences curricula through constructive alignments and promote health sciences education in the current 4IR. This would allow graduates to be better prepared for digitalised practice environments. © 2023, The Author(s).",Computer-Assisted Instruction; Curriculum; Health Promotion; Humans; South Africa; Telemedicine; adult; article; citizenship; data analysis; e-learning; female; health education; human; human experiment; interview; learning; male; medical education; perception; South Africa; tertiary education; curriculum; health promotion; teaching; telemedicine,Health Sciences

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among medical, pharmacy, nursing, and midwife students in their last year of health sciences training in the University of Abomey-Calavi in Benin. Students completed a self-administered questionnaire, containing items addressing demographics, epilepsy treatment, diagnosis, clinical practice, and social tolerance regarding a person with epilepsy (PWE). Results: The response rate to our survey was 87.7% (n = 164). The sample consisted of 64 medical students, 22 pharmacy students, 43 nursing students, and 35 midwife students. They were divided into 95 female subjects and 69 males; sex ratio was 0.7. The mean age of participants was 23.6 ± 1.8 years. The mean scores for epilepsy knowledge, practices, and attitudes were respectively 7.6 ± 1.7 out of a maximum score of 11, 3.9 ± 1.8 out of 8, and 9.6 ± 0.8 out of 10. The KAP overall score was 21.1 ± 3.4 out of a maximum score of 29.0. The variables associated with the overall KAP score were training school, gender, having heard about epilepsy before health sciences studies (p = 0.017), and having a relative with epilepsy (p = 0.001). Male students and medical school students had significantly better overall KAP score than female students or the other training schools respectively (p < 0.001).

Methods: A scoping review was conducted. The Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, EBSCO, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data, and CBM databases were searched from September 2016 to November 2022. Manual searching was also performed to identify additional eligible studies. A total of 2620 documents were initially retrieved, and 29 were ultimately included. The literature was screened and collected, and data were extracted and summarized by 2 researchers. Results: (1) The quality evaluation tools used in the 29 papers included the DISCERN, PEMAT(A/V), GQS, JAMA, HONcode, guidelines and self-developed tools. Twenty-four of the included articles used the DISCERN for quality assessment, which was the most frequently used evaluation tool. However, most of these tools were not developed to assess health science-related short videos, lacked credibility tests, and had poor applicability; therefore, the accuracy of the evaluation results might be biased. (2) The assessors of the quality of health science-related short videos on TikTok were mainly experts in related fields and medical students, with doctors (12/14) being the most common evaluators. Fifteen studies did not report the identity of the evaluators, and 12 studies did not report interrater reliability. Conclusion: This scoping review found that there is a lack of specific quality assessment tools for health science-related short videos on TikTok. Second, the current quality assessors of health science-related short videos on TikTok are limited. Future research should focus on the development of reliable, scientific quality assessment tools for health science-related short videos; unifying the evaluation standards; inviting users with different backgrounds and different health literacy levels to conduct quality assessments; exploring the quality assessment of health science-related short videos on TikTok from different perspectives. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Databases, Factual; Health Literacy; Health Status; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Social Media; E health; Health information on the web; Health informations; Health science; Health science-related short video; Quality; Scoping review; Tiktok; Video sharing; Video-sharing site; Chinese Biomedical database; Cochrane Library; health literacy; human; interrater reliability; medical information; medical student; practice guideline; quality assessment tool; quality control; review; scoping review; social media; systematic review; telehealth; videorecording; WanFang Database; Web of Science; factual database; health literacy; health status; reproducibility; Quality control",Health Sciences

Scholars are motivated by a number of factors to choose a career in health sciences. Determining these factors among rural and urban-origin students could inform recruitment and retention strategies to redress this imbalance. Objectives: To determine and compare motivating factors for a career in health sciences among Rural-Origin (ROS) and Urban-Origin Students (UOS) at three South African universities. Methods: Three institutions (former University of Limpopo (Medunsa Campus), now Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University (SMU), University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) and University of Cape Town (UCT) participated in the study 2011. Health science students completed a self-administered questionnaire. The SAS® (version 9.2) for Microsoft statistical software was used for analysis. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Results: A total of 1633 health sciences students participated in the study. Parents (505; 30.9%) and personal exposure (484; 29.6%) were the main motivating factors for both ROS and UOS, with significantly more UOS than ROS motivated by these factors (p < 0.001). The contribution of role models (93; 5.7%), friends (77; 4.7%), high school teachers (77; 4.7%), mentors (36; 2.2%) and university lecturers (18; 1.1%) was minimal, with no significant difference between UOS and ROS (p > 0.05).

However, it was found that the Bioethics course is only available in nine of these institutions. In summary, it can be affirmed that in the educational programs of careers related to health sciences, attempts are made to address ethical principles from different perspectives, for example, through courses on general ethics or deontology. However, this strategy is not considered adequate.

Methods: A sample of 270 health sciences employees from Turkey was given a modified version of LIPT. Scale reliability of the modified LIPT was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine the factor structure of the modified LIPT in Mplus 6. Results: The modified LIPT indicated high reliability (Cronbach’s alpha >0.80). A six-factor model was chosen to explain the modified LIPT scale based on the satisfactory fit indices from exploratory factor analyses. The model fit of the same model was also tested using confirmatory factor analysis and the results were again satisfactory in terms of model-data fit. The Tucker-Lewis Index and comparative fit index indices are both greater than 0.90 for both exploratory and confirmatory models.

Objectives: Academies initially formed at individual medical schools. Educators and leaders in The University of Texas System (the UT System, UTS) recognized the academy movement as a means both to address special challenges and pursue opportunities for advancing the educational mission of academic health sciences institutions. Methods: The UTS academy process was started by the appointment of a Chancellor's Health Fellow for Education in 2004. Subsequently, the University of Texas Academy of Health Science Education (UTAHSE) was formed by bringing together esteemed faculty educators from the six UTS health science institutions. Results: Currently, the UTAHSE has 132 voting members who were selected through a rigorous, system-wide peer review and who represent multiple professional backgrounds and all six campuses. With support from the UTS, the UTAHSE has developed and sustained an annual Innovations in Health Science Education conference, a small grants program and an Innovations in Health Science Education Award, among other UTS health science educational activities. The UTAHSE represents one university system's innovative approach to enhancing its educational mission through multi- and interdisciplinary as well as inter-institutional collaboration. Conclusions: The UTAHSE is presented as a model for the development of other consortia-type academies that could involve several components of a university system or coalitions of several institutions. © 2013 L.

In a field, such as librarianship that incorporates technology, it is even more important. In health science librarianship, the need for professional development has long been regarded as important in providing quality service. This study’s main objective was to determine the preferred professional development method(s) used by health sciences librarians. A survey was developed using Qualtrics and sent out through various listservs used by health sciences librarians and completed by 159 health sciences librarians. Health science librarians answered questions about use and preference as well as rating the resources on how these methods met their professional development needs. The results of this study provide data and insight on which types of professional development health science librarians prefer and which they find most helpful as they become familiar with the nuances that come with serving as a health science librarian. Having a better understanding of the support needed and proven resources can help health sciences librarians on-board to their job sooner and to advocate for future professional development. © 2023 The Author(s).

Proper recognition of such issues can significantly contribute to a better understanding of the causes of the crisis of trust in science and help to find an effective and socially acceptable solution to mitigate it. Our study was aimed at identifying and systematizing the public needs and expectations towards medical and health sciences, based on the example of the population of Katowice. Materials and methods: The study was carried out using a mixed, qualitative-quantitative methodology. Based on the conclusions of the in-depth interviews, a questionnaire was constructed to check the level of awareness of residents of Katowice obtaining the title of the European City of Science 2024 and the respondents’ opinion on the development of medical and health sciences. 400 inhabitants of the city and/or people associated with it through their work or education took part in the questionnaire survey. Results: Only 7.8% of respondents had in-depth knowledge about the European City of Science 2024 project, with further 28.8% declaring some level of general knowledge of the issue. Study participants associated medical and health sciences with health promotion and clinical specialties (43% and 33,5% respectively). In terms of further development of medical and health sciences in Katowice study participants prioritized mainly development of research in chronic and lifestyle-related diseases (51%) and the need of development of prevention and health promotion (46.3%) as well as clinical medicine (32.8%). The inhabitants of the city recognize the resources of the city and the region in the field of medical sciences and health sciences as large and with high development potential. Conclusions: The events organized as part of the European City of Science 2024 should become a good opportunity to promote and disseminate knowledge about the achievements and development potential of the City and the Region in the field of medical and health sciences. © The Author(s) 2024.",Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Poland; Qualitative Research; Science; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; article; awareness; city; diagnosis; education; epidemiology; European; expectation; female; health promotion; health science; human; interview; knowledge; lifestyle; literacy; major clinical study; male; methodology; perception; prevention; questionnaire; trust; young adult; aged; middle aged; Poland; qualitative research; questionnaire; science,Health Sciences

However, it has been questioned whether or not these students apply such knowledge. While studies have been conducted on the lifestyle habits of students in general, few have compared the practices of Health Science students with those of other students. The objectives of this study were to compare the eating patterns, alcohol consumption and physical activity of Health Science students with those of other students. Design: A cross-sectional study design that utilised an electronic self-administered survey was applied. Data were analysed using SPSS® and Pearson’s chi-square test (p-value < 0.050). Subjects and setting: A convenience sample (n = 619), consisting of registered students at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, participated, after providing informed consent. Outcomes measures: Dietary patterns and frequency of intake, alcohol consumption and physical activity were measured. Results: A statistical difference was not reported between the eating patterns, alcohol consumption and physical activity of Health Science students and those of other students. Most of the students exhibited poor dietary behaviour. For example, 65% of Health Science students and 67% of students in other faculties consumed less than one fruit per day, 70% of Health Science students and 64% of other students consumed less than one vegetable per day, while 91% of Health Science students and 93% of students in other faculties consumed less than two glasses of milk per day. Although not significant, fewer Health Science students (4%) than students of other faculties (9%) consumed alcohol more than twice a week. Binge drinking was more common in Health Science students. Forty-eight per cent of the Health Science students indicated that they were physically inactive, compared to 49% of students in other faculties. Conclusion: Students studying Health Science do not have a healthier lifestyle than other students. Further theory-based intervention studies to determine the reasons for this behaviour need to be undertaken. Strategies should be developed to encourage behavioural change. © SAJCN.",adult; alcohol consumption; Article; binge drinking; body mass; caloric intake; cross-sectional study; demography; drinking; feeding behavior; female; food intake; health education; human; knowledge; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; male; middle aged; physical activity; questionnaire; South African; weight gain,Health Sciences

We looked into the particular impacts that the kinds of digital empowerment that the health science popularization platform has made available to older adults have on them. In this study, we also developed, from the perspective of digital empowerment, the mechanism model of the health science popularization platform on the eHealth literacy of older adults. This study employed a questionnaire survey approach to gathering data, primarily using an online platform to ask older persons with prior experience using a platform for the popularization of health science to fill out. 248 participants aged over 50 took part in the study and finished the survey up to standard. The SmartPLS4.0 program was used to analyze the data using the PLS-SEM approach. According to the findings, the health science popularization platform significantly affects older adults’ capacity to look for and use health information, and as a result, older adults’ self-efficacy and ease of use support their eHealth literacy. By enhancing information push, simplifying function operation, and other measures during the future development of the health science popularization platform, we may assist older adults in adjusting to digital technology and thereby advance eHealth literacy, finally help bridge the digital divide. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Digital technologies; Ehealth; Ehealth literacy; Health informations; Health science; Health science popularization platform; Older adults; PLS-SEM; Science popularisation; Senior user; eHealth,Health Sciences

This expansion has encouraged a new role for librarians to assume, in that a subset of health sciences librarians identify as “satellite librarians” who are permanently located at a distance from the main campus. Due to the unique nature of this role and lack of existing data on the topic, the authors investigated the experiences and perceptions of this unique group of information professionals. Methods: An electronic survey was distributed to health sciences librarians via two prominent North American email discussion lists. Questions addressed the librarians’ demographics, feelings of social inclusion, technological support, autonomy, professional support, and more. Results: Eighteen surveys were analyzed. While several respondents stated that they had positive working relationships with colleagues, many cited issues with technology, scheduling, and lack of consideration as barriers to feeling socially included at both the parent and local campuses. Social inclusion, policy creation, and collection management issues were subject to their unique situations and their colleagues’ perceptions of their roles as satellite librarians. Conclusions: The results from this survey suggest that the role of the academic health sciences librarian at the satellite campus needs to be clearly communicated and defined. This, in turn, will enhance the experience for the librarian and provide better service to the client. © 2018, Medical Library Association.

A comprehensive literature review of the published studies was undertaken related to BDA, including the diffusion of innovation theory, and the theoretical background of the technology acceptance model to produce an application-based big data development framework for the health sciences libraries. The application-based evaluation model integrates BDA in health sciences libraries for improving library services and performance. The study proposed a need for skilled professionals with the knowledge and experience both professionally and technically.

SHS aims to produce a broad range of health manpower who serves the rural communities. It also designs and tests program models for health manpower development that can be replicated in various parts of the Philippines and in other countries as well. Its unique feature is the step-ladder curriculum---the only one of its kind in the Philippines---which is designed to meet the needs of the rural communities. Here, instead of the usual approach to health science education, the training of a broad range of health manpower from the barangay (village) health worker to the medical doctor is integrated in a single, sequential, and continuous curriculum. Each program lasts from one to more than 10 quarters (one quarter =11 weeks) and is followed by a service leave of an indefinite period. The curriculum has been featured in many monographs, journals, magazine articles, and official reports of WHO for serving as a model for shifting health science education from the hospital to the community.

Due to numerous incorrect or insufficient knowledge attributed to epilepsy, people have negative attitudes against the disease. This study was performed to examine the knowledge levels and attitudes about epilepsy of undergraduate students studying at the faculty of health sciences in Turkey. Methods: In the study, the epilepsy knowledge level and attitudes towards epilepsy and the person with epilepsy were evaluated in 1,019 students studying at the faculty of health sciences at Konya Selcuk University. The scales of epilepsy knowledge and attitudes towards epilepsy were transformed into an online form and sent to participants’ e-mail addresses. Results: Two hundred eighty (27.5%) students read scientific documents about epilepsy. Especially those who read textbooks and scientific articles/research articles had a higher level of knowledge (p = 0.002). The least well-known issue was related to the treatment of the disease. Although most students had a high level of epilepsy knowledge, they had negative attitudes especially toward dating and marriage with epileptic individuals. Female, clinical students, those who witnessed epileptic seizures, and those who had a higher level of knowledge about epilepsy had more positive attitudes towards epilepsy (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Negative attitudes towards epilepsy patients still exist among health science students in Turkey. Health sciences faculty education programs should be designed to increase the epilepsy awareness of students. Increasing the level of knowledge and awareness may lead to better attitudes. © 2022, ASEAN Neurological Association.

Health sciences education is evolving and hybrid learning is becoming increasingly common. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how hybrid education influences the competence development of health sciences students. In this study, hybrid learning means synchronised simultaneous learning in a group of students, where face-to-face and online teaching occurs via the hybrid learning environment. Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the experiences of health sciences students with hybrid learning in health sciences education. Design: This is a qualitative descriptive study. Participants: A total of 19 health sciences students, who participated in hybrid learning, both face-to-face and online, were interviewed. Methods: The data were collected using semi-structured focus group interviews during winter 2022. Data were analysed inductively using content analysis. Results: The experiences of health sciences students revealed that successful hybrid learning requires educators to have pedagogical, technical, ethical and interaction competences, effective technical solutions, and shared interactivity. Students indicated that hybrid learning enables meaningful learning as well as supports their competence development and well-being. Students need support for hybrid learning, for which organisational support is considered important. In addition, students desire that hybrid learning be developed as a student-centred and varied learning method. Conclusions: The results of this research can be used in the development of health sciences education, in ensuring the development of competence among health sciences students, and in supporting the digital pedagogical competence of health sciences educators. © 2023 The Author(s)","Health Education; Health Personnel; Humans; Learning; Qualitative Research; Students; Students, Nursing; adult; article; clinical article; content analysis; controlled study; female; health education; human; human experiment; interview; learning; learning environment; male; qualitative research; teaching; tertiary education; wellbeing; winter; education; health care personnel; health education; nursing student; qualitative research; student",Health Sciences

Understanding and fostering a sustainable educational environment (EE) is essential in optimising their learning and the successful completion of their studies. A convergent mixed-methods study was conducted to explore health science students’ experiences of their EE at the largest public university in Brunei Darussalam. A cross-sectional design using the DREEM questionnaire (n = 150) and four focus group discussions (n = 31) involving five health science programs (biomedical sciences, dentistry, medicine, nursing/midwifery, and pharmacy) was conducted between November 2021 and May 2022. Descriptive and linear regression analyses and thematic analysis were respectively performed on the quantitative and qualitative data. Although the university EE was experienced by students as “more positive than negative” (86.7%), 13.3% perceived it as having “plenty of problems”. This perception of learning was statistically significant among nursing/midwifery students (p = 0.012). Dentistry students reported positive perceptions across all five domains of the DREEM (an overall mean of 119.3 ± 10.3). The importance of a stimulating home learning environment, supportive peers, innovative teaching methods, soft skill development, and clinical learning enhancement were highlighted. To foster independence and student-centred learning, an educational program that empowers students on their EE, including ‘survival skills’ is recommended. Future research should compare health science students’ experiences in university and clinical EE, nationally and abroad (medical and dentistry twinning program), and develop indicators measuring the sustainability of the EE throughout health science programs. © 2023 by the authors.",Borneo; Brunei Darussalam; health care; health education; health science; learning; perception; questionnaire survey; student; teaching,Health Sciences

Data Sources: The health, social, behavioral, biological, library, earth, and management sciences literatures were used as sources. Study Selection: All fields except for health sciences librarianship were scanned topically for either well-known or diverse applications of the cohort design. The health sciences library literature available to the author principally for the years 1990 to 2000, supplemented by papers or posters presented at annual meetings of the Medical Library Association. Data Extraction: A narrative review for the health, social, behavioral, biological, earth, and management sciences literatures and a systematic review for health sciences librarianship literature for the years 1990 to 2000, with three exceptions, were conducted. The author conducted principally a manual search of the health sciences librarianship literature for the years 1990 to 2000 as part of this systematic review. Main Results: The cohort design has been applied to answer a wide array of theoretical or practical research questions in the health, social, behavioral, biological, and management sciences. Health sciences librarianship also offers several major applications of the cohort design. Conclusion: The cohort design has great potential for answering research questions in the field of health sciences librarianship, particularly evidence-based librarianship (EBL), although that potential has not been fully explored.","Cohort Studies; Humans; Libraries, Medical; Library Science; Research Design; article; behavioral science; biomedicine; cohort analysis; geology; health science; librarian; library; professional practice; sociology",Health Sciences

These guidelines, however, include many discrepancies, both in terms of vocabulary and structure. Many expert evaluators also decry the absence of consensual and reliable evaluation tools. To address this gap, we present the results of an evaluation of 58 existing guidelines in four major health science fields (medicine and epidemiology; nursing and health education; social sciences and public health; psychology/psychiatry, research methods and organization) by expert (n = 16) and peer (n = 40) users (e.g., article reviewers, experts allocating funds, editors).

Health research has expanded astoundingly over the last century and a variety of scientific disciplines rooted in very different scientific and intellectual traditions has contributed to these goals. To allow health scientists to fully contextualize their work and engage in interdisciplinary research, a common understanding of the health sciences is needed. The aim of this paper is to respond to the call of the 1986 Ottawa Charter to improve health care by looking both within and beyond health and health care, and to use the opportunity offered by WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) for a universal operationalization of health, in order to develop a common understanding and conceptualization of the field of health sciences that account for its richness and vitality. Methods: A critical analysis of health sciences based on WHO's ICF, on WHO's definition of health systems and on the content and methodological approaches promoted by the biological, clinical and socio-humanistic traditions engaged in health research. Results: The field of health sciences is presented according to: 1) a specification of the content of the field in terms of people's health needs and the societal response to them, 2) a meta-level framework to exhaustively represent the range of mutually recognizable scientific disciplines engaged in health research and 3) a heuristic framework for the specification of a set of shared methodological approaches relevant across the range of these disciplines.

Some LIS programs have health sciences courses or tracks, but health sciences training within an LIS program is only one path to entering health sciences librarianship. To develop a map of pathways into health sciences librarianship, an immersion session at the Medical Library Association conference in 2022 asked health sciences librarians to share how they entered the profession. Methods: The immersion session was structured in three parts: facilitator introductions, small group discussions, and a whole group summary discussion. Guided by questions from the facilitators, small groups discussed what pathways currently exist, how to promote existing pathways, what new pathways should be created, and how to develop and promote pathways that make the profession more equitable, diverse, and inclusive. Results: Through in-the-moment thematic analysis of the small group discussions, the following emerged as key pathways: library school education; internships and practica; the Library and Information Science (LIS) pipeline; on-the-job training; mentoring; self-teaching/hands-on learning; and continuing education. Themes of equity, diversity, and inclusion arose throughout the session, especially in the concluding whole group discussion. Conclusion: Small group discussions in a conference immersion session showed the value of community building in a profession that has multiple pathways for entrance, highlighting the importance of unearthing hidden knowledge about avenues for exploring and enhancing career pathways. The article seeks to address barriers to entry into the profession and adds to the literature on strengthening the field of health sciences librarianship. © 2023, Medical Library Association.

Apart from surgical education, robots have also been widely employed in assistive and rehabilitation procedures, where education has traditionally focused in the patient. Therefore, there has been extensive review bibliography in the field of medical robotics focused on surgical and rehabilitation and assistive robots, but there is a lack of survey papers that explore the potential of robotics in the education of healthcare students and professionals beyond their training in the use of the robotic system. The scope of the current review are works in which robots are used as didactic tools for the education of professionals in health sciences, investigating the enablers and barriers that affect the use of robots as learning facilitators. Systematic literature searches were conducted in WOS and Scopus, yielding a total of 3812 candidate papers. After removing duplicates, inclusion criteria were defined and applied, resulting in 171 papers. An in-depth quality assessment was then performed leading to 26 papers for qualitative synthesis. Results show that robots in health sciences education are still developed with a roboticist mindset, without clearly incorporating aspects of the teaching/learning process. However, they have proven potential to be used in health sciences as they allow to parameterize procedures, autonomously guide learners to achieve greater engagement, or enable collective learning including patients and instructors ""in the loop"". Although there exist documented added-value benefits, further research and efforts needs to be done to foster the inclusion of robots as didactic tools in the curricula of health sciences professionals. On the one hand, by analyzing how robotic technology should be developed to become more flexible and usable to support both teaching and learning processes in health sciences education, as final users are not necessarily well-versed in how to use it. On the other, there continues to be a need to develop effective and standard robotic enhanced learning evaluation tools, as well good quality studies that describe effective evaluation of robotic enhanced education for professionals in health sciences. As happens with other technologies when applied to the health sciences field, studies often fail to provide sufficient detail to support transferability or direct future robotic health care education programs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Curriculum; Health Personnel; Humans; Learning; Midazolam; Robotics; midazolam; adult; education; education program; female; field study; health education; human; learning; male; medical education; quality control; review; robotics; Scopus; synthesis; systematic review; curriculum; education; health care personnel,Health Sciences

The United States, European Union, and Australia have placed citizen science at the forefront of national science policy. Journals such as Science, Nature and Bioscience regularly feature projects conducted by citizens. Citizen science engages millions of people worldwide. However, to date, population health science has not relied heavily on citizen contributions. Although community-based participatory action research remains a strong foundational method to engage those affected by public health problems, there is additional potential to mainstream population health through wider, less intensive opportunities to be involved in our science. If we are to tackle the complex challenges that face population health then new avenues are needed to capture the energy and attention of citizens who may not feel affected by public health problems, i.e. to engage the ‘by-standers’ in population health science. Particular types of citizen science methods have the potential to do this. But simply increasing the breadth and volume of scientific evidence will not be enough. Complex, intractable, macro-level problems in population health require change in how our journals and funding bodies respond to data generated by the public. Of course, democratisation of science and the potential decentralisation of scientific authority will bring deep challenges. But potentially it brings a future where population health science is better known, understood and respected, with benefits for the types of public policies that derive from this science. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",attention; Australia; community participation; European Union; funding; health science; human; information processing; public health problem; public policy; United States,Health Sciences

Given the significant negative impact that depression and anxiety can have on undergraduate health science students, it is essential to understand the prevalence and correlation of these conditions in this population. In light of this, this scoping review aims to identify, document, and analyze the literature on the prevalence and determinants of anxiety and depression among undergraduate health sciences students and identify gaps in knowledge for future research. Methods: This scoping review was planned and executed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for the Scoping Reviews statement. A comprehensive and systematic search was carried out for five databases, namely MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PubMed. Results: From the literature identified by our search strategy, the lowest prevalence for anxiety was 5.8%, and the highest was 82.6%, with a median of 44.25%. The prevalence of depression ranged from a high of 88.8% to a low of 2.1%, with a median value of 34.8%. Our analysis revealed that correlates of anxiety and depression among health science students include sociodemographic factors such as age, sex, gender, relationships, ethnicity, and family history, personal health conditions, and academic and socioeconomic issues. Conclusions: With the high incidence of anxiety and depression among health science students, there is an increasing need to find practical remedies to support these students. It is also essential for policymakers and university authorities to implement interventions such as supportive text messages and other strategies geared toward providing support and improving the psychological well-being of health science students. © 2023 by the authors.",,Health Sciences

Meeting these expectations increasingly depends on partnership working between university medical schools and teaching hospitals, as well as other healthcare providers. However, academic-clinical relationships in England are still characterised by the ""unlinked partners"" model, whereby universities and their partner teaching hospitals are neither fiscally nor structurally linked, creating bifurcating accountabilities to various government and public agencies. Discussion: This article focuses on accountability relationships in universities and teaching hospitals, as well as other healthcare providers that form core constituent parts of academic health science centres and networks. The authors analyse accountability for the tripartite mission of patient care, research, and education, using a four-fold typology of accountability relationships, which distinguishes between hierarchical (bureaucratic) accountability, legal accountability, professional accountability, and political accountability. Examples from North West London suggest that a number of mechanisms can be used to improve accountability for the tripartite mission through alignment, but that the simple creation of academic health science centres and networks is probably not sufficient. Summary: At the heart of the challenge for academic health science centres and networks is the separation of accountabilities for patient care, research, and education in different government departments. Given that a fundamental top-down system redesign is now extremely unlikely, local academic and clinical leaders face the challenge of aligning their institutions as a matter of priority in order to improve accountability for the tripartite mission from the bottom up. It remains to be seen which alignment mechanisms are most effective, and whether they are strong enough to counter the separation of accountabilities for the tripartite mission at the national level, the on-going structural fragmentation of the health system in England, and the unprecedented financial challenges that it faces. Future research should focus on determining the comparative effectiveness of different alignment mechanisms, developing standardised metrics and key performance indicators, evaluating and assessing academic health science centres and networks, and empirically addressing leadership issues. © 2014 Ovseiko et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Academic Medical Centers; Biomedical Research; England; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Interinstitutional Relations; Models, Organizational; Quality of Health Care; Social Responsibility; State Medicine; article; health care quality; human; legal aspect; medical research; national health service; nonbiological model; organization and management; public relations; social behavior; standard; teaching hospital; United Kingdom; university hospital",Health Sciences

However, the practice of QCA is increasingly critically discussed under epistemological and methodological aspects. In this article, the use and application of QCA in health sciences are empirically examined. For this purpose, the results of a systematic review of the practice of QCA are discussed using peer-reviewed articles from relevant journals with a focus on health sciences. Based on the findings we further explore how the word qualitative in QCA is interpreted and implemented in the research practice of the health sciences. We also reflect the fit between data collection and evaluation, consider the quality of the analysis and discuss typical features of qualitative research. © 2020, Institut für Qualitative Forschung,Internationale Akademie Berlin gGmbH.

We aimed to determine the sexual health knowledge and affecting factors of health science students in Turkey. Methods: A descriptive study was carried out among students at a university faculty of health sciences in Ankara province, Turkey. Data were collected using a student information form and the Sexual Health Knowledge Test (SHKT). Results: The study comprised 738 participants. Students’ mean SHKT score was moderate (25.13 ± 5.28; range 0–40). The lowest correct response rates in the SHKT were to questions on sexually transmitted infections (45.6%) and safe sexual behaviour (53.5%). Students’ main sources of information on sexual health were the internet (72%) and friends (40.9%). The most important factors affecting SHKT scores were having graduated from a health-education high school (eta2 = 0.035); having a working mother (eta2 = 0.023); getting sexual health information from the internet (eta2 = 0.019), from friends (eta2 = 0.018) or from school/teachers (eta2 = 0.015); having friends of the opposite sex for emotional and/or social support (eta2 = 0.010); and being female (eta2 = 0.008). Conclusion: The results indicate the importance of educating young people and their parents about sexual health. We recommend that the sexual health educational needs of university students in health sciences should not be overlooked; these students have similar needs to those of students in other fields. © 2021 The European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health.","Adolescent; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Health; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Turkey; Universities; adolescent; adult; Article; descriptive research; emotional support; female; friend; gender identity; health education; health science; high school graduate; human; Internet; male; medical student; parent; professional knowledge; risk factor; safe sex; school teacher; sex difference; sexual behavior; sexual health; sexually transmitted disease; social support; Turkey (republic); working mother; attitude to health; questionnaire; sexually transmitted disease; student; turkey (bird); university",Health Sciences

While a federated search engine may offer speedy search capabilities, do they offer the same accuracy and relevancy as directly searching the core health sciences databases? The purpose of this study is to describe, evaluate, and compare searching health sciences topics using a federated search engine versus searching five core health sciences databases directly. The following databases were selected for this study: WebFeat (federated search engine), MEDLINE, CINAHL, Science Citation Index, Biological Abstracts, and EMBASE. While WebFeat is convenient for searching multiple databases simultaneously, it does not offer the advanced search limits offered by directly searching some of the health sciences databases.

Due to the changes caused by the global pandemic, health sciences education has shifted more to online and hybrid contexts, which can challenge students' competence development. Students' competence development and interaction in collaborative hybrid learning is a little researched area. Objectives: To observe and evaluate health sciences students' competence development in a collaborative hybrid learning context. Methods: This quasi-experimental mixed-method study was implemented by providing educational intervention. First-year Bachelor's degree health sciences students (n = 18) of a Finnish university completed an educational intervention with synchronous online and face-to-face learning. Students' collaborative hybrid learning and interaction were video observed, while self-evaluation of competence development was made with a questionnaire. Results: In the collaborative interactions, the students showed analytical thinking, problem- solving and communication and technology skills. Extensive knowledge of health sciences and ethics skills was not strongly visible in interaction. The students effectively used collaborative work time to perform tasks. Cognitive interaction (monitoring and evaluating learning) was observed in 85% and socio-emotional interaction (expressions of emotions and motivation) in 53% of the data. Related to the students' learning results, the students' ability to communicate and interact with culturally different people improved after the educational intervention. Conclusion: Collaborative learning methods in hybrid learning can create opportunities for students to construct their competence in interaction. Attention should be paid to different areas of competence and the role of socio-emotional interaction. © 2023 The Authors.

This study analysed the differences in attitudes towards healthcare teams between health science students at Gunma University, Japan, which implements a comprehensive interprofessional education (IPE) programme, and Kanazawa University, a similar national university. Study populations were first- and third-year students at the Gunma University School of Health Sciences and the Kanazawa University School of Health Sciences. The present study was performed just after the IPE and multi-professional education subjects at Gunma University in the first term of the 2012 academic year. The first-year students were different cohort from the third-year students. The modified Attitudes Toward Health Care Teams Scale (ATHCTS) was used to measure attitudes towards healthcare teams. The overall mean score on the modified ATHCTS of students at Gunma University was significantly higher than that of those at Kanazawa University. In both first- and third-year students, the regression factor score of “patient-centred care” was significantly higher at Gunma University than at Kanazawa University. Based on the present study, it can be stated that IPE may foster the value of collaborative practice (CP) among health science students. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Adult; Cooperative Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Japan; Male; Patient Care Team; Patient-Centered Care; Students, Health Occupations; Young Adult; adult; education program; female; health science; human; human experiment; Japan; male; remission; school health service; student attitude; vocational education; cooperation; cross-sectional study; health student; organization and management; patient care; psychology; public relations; young adult",Health Sciences

The increase in hybrid education in higher education provides flexible education but also causes additional stress for educators. In order to develop educators' competencies in hybrid teaching, it is necessary to understand educators' experiences of that. In this study, hybrid teaching means synchronous face-to-face and distance teaching. Objectives: The study aims to describe the experiences of social and health care and health sciences educators of hybrid teaching in higher education. Design: We employed a qualitative descriptive research design. Participants: A total of 21 social and health care and health sciences educators were interviewed. Methods: The data was collected through semi-structured interviews in seven group interviews and an individual interview from February 2022 to April 2022. The data was analysed using inductive content analysis. Results: Educators felt that hybrid education brought flexibility to their teaching activities and have implemented it successfully. Moreover, educators shared that implementing hybrid teaching requires them to have pedagogical competence and technology skills, ensuring interaction with students and creating a safe learning environment. Their positive attitude towards digital pedagogy is essential. Educators recognised the need to ensure students' digital skills in hybrid education. Moreover, challenges related to assessment were also identified. Educators experienced increased workload due to pressures, psychological strain and distribution of attention. They felt that they needed support and adequate resources to implement it. Conclusions: The results have societal value in enhancing educators' continual professional development, developing high-quality evidence-based teaching and student skills, and assessing and applying different digital solutions to hybrid education. © 2023 The Authors",Curriculum; Delivery of Health Care; Health Personnel; Humans; Learning; Qualitative Research; Teaching; article; attitude; content analysis; descriptive research; education; female; health practitioner; health science; human; interview; learning; learning environment; male; professional development; qualitative research; semi structured interview; social care; teaching; tertiary education; workload; curriculum; health care delivery; health care personnel; psychology; qualitative research; teaching,Health Sciences

The complex interplay of social, religious, and media influences behind organ donation in today's social milieu is not fully understood. Health-care professionals are in a unique position to influence popular perception on organ donation through their practices. Objectives: The objective of this study was to explore organ donation-related perceptions and practices among health science students from southern India. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based, online descriptive study was carried out among undergraduate health science students from the medical, nursing, and allied health science streams in Coimbatore, western Tamil Nadu. A total of 618 respondents participated in the online survey conducted during the summer 2021. Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS version 27 statistical package. Results: The general awareness levels and perceptions regarding organ donation were fairly high, and 83.1% were interested in becoming an organ donor. Even though a sizable proportion (37.4%) were ready to pledge right away, many did not know how to take the next step - the actual pledging for organ donation. Apprehensions relating to organ donation fell under few major themes - concerns of misuse of organ donation platforms for monetary gains; cumbersome legal procedures; family, social, and religious beliefs; and influences of popular media. Conclusions: Despite a fair degree of knowledge, the practice of organ donation seems to be relatively low among the participants, owing to a multitude of reasons. If enabled appropriately, health science graduates would be the perfect ambassadors for promoting organ donation in the society. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

The education of health science teachers varies internationally and there is no consensus about the minimum qualifications and experience they require. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to describe the health science teachers’ competences and the factors related to it. Design: Systematic review of original quantitative studies. Data sources: Four databases were selected from which to retrieve original studies: Cinahl (Ebsco), PubMed, Medic, Eri (ProQuest). Review Methods: The systematic review used PICOS inclusion criteria. Original peer-reviewed quantitative studies published between 1/2007 and 1/2018 were identified. Screening was conducted by two researchers separately reading the 1885 titles, 600 abstracts, and 63 full-texts that were identified, and then agreed between them. Critical appraisal was performed using the JBI MAStARI evaluation tool. The data was extracted and then analysed narratively. Results: The core competences of health science teachers include areas of knowledge, skills and attitudes. Health science teachers evaluate their own competence as high. Only in relation to entrepreneurship and leadership knowledge was evaluated to be average. The most common factors influencing competence were teachers’ title/position, healthcare experience, research activities, age, academic degree and for which type of organisation they work. Conclusion: It is important to identify the core competencies required by health science teachers in order to train highly competent healthcare professionals. Based on the findings of this systematic review we suggest that teachers should be encouraged to gain university education and actively participate in research, and that younger teachers should have opportunities to practice the relevant teaching skills to build competence. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Clinical Competence; Delivery of Health Care; Education, Graduate; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Occupations; Humans; Leadership; Teaching; Cinahl; entrepreneurship; health science; human; human experiment; leadership; Medline; review; scientist; skill; systematic review; teacher; teaching; academic achievement; attitude to health; clinical competence; health care delivery; medical profession; standards",Health Sciences

These      approaches      rely      on biological data repositories and bioinformatic analyses,      both      of      which      are      growing      rapidly in size and scope. Libraries play a key role in      supporting      researchers      in      navigating      these      and other information resources. Methods:      With      the      goal      of      supporting      bioinformatics research in the health sciences, the University      of      Arizona      Health      Sciences      Library      established a Bioinformation program. To shape      the      support      provided      by      the      library, I developed and administered a needs assessment      survey      to      the      University      of      Arizona Health Sciences campus in Tucson, Arizona. The      survey      was      designed      to      identify      the training topics of interest to health sciences      researchers      and      the      preferred      modes      of training. Results: Survey respondents expressed      an      interest      in      a      broad      array of potential training topics, including ""traditional""      information      seeking      as      well      as      interest in analytical training. Of particular interest      were      training      in      transcriptomic      tools      and the use of databases linking genotypes      and      phenotypes.      Staff      were      most      interested in bioinformatics training topics, while      faculty      were      the      least      interested.      Hands-on workshops were significantly preferred      over      any      other      mode      of      training. The University of Arizona Health Sciences Library      is      meeting      those      needs      through      internal programming and external partnerships. Conclusion:      The      results      of      the      survey      demonstrate a keen interest in a variety of bioinformatic      resources;      the      challenge      to      the      library is how to address those training needs. The      mode      of      support      depends      largely      on library staff expertise in the numerous subject-specific      databases      and      tools.      Librarian-led      bioinformatic      training sessions provide opportunities      for      engagement      with      researchers      at      multiple points of the research life cycle. When      training      needs      exceed      library      capacity,      partnering with intramural and extramural units will be crucial in library      support      of health sciences bioinformatic research. © 2017 Jeffrey C.

There is limited research exploring health literacy proficiency among undergraduate health science students. Objectives: To determine health literacy among health science students in Singapore using the electronic Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). Design: A cross-sectional survey using purposive sampling was conducted among undergraduate health science students. Methodology: This study hypothesises that health literacy is influenced by gender, and it increases with the level of health science education, attributed to the increased exposure to the health care system and health care education as undergraduates progress through the years of study. Eligible students from the 4-year entry-level programmes of diagnostic radiography, dietetics, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, radiation therapy and speech and language therapy, aged from 21 to 50, were invited. Exclusion criteria were students who were no longer studying due to dropping out or having immediately graduated from these programmes and students in the accelerated programmes whose studies would be completed in less than 4 years. Results: In total, 111 respondents (72 females and 37 males) completed surveys (response rate, 7.7%) returned from physiotherapy (n = 69), occupational therapy (n = 25), diagnostic radiography (n = 12) and dietetics (n = 5), with nil from radiation therapy and speech and language therapy. All participants were English literate. Female participants demonstrated higher HLQ with a mean total score of 30.67 (standard deviation (SD) = 0.61) versus male participants 29.83 (SD = 0.53). Year 2, 3 and 4 students generally scored higher than Year 1 across all nine HLQ scales. Overall, dietetics students had the highest total score on the HLQ, while the diagnostic radiography students had the lowest scores for all the nine HLQ scales. Conclusion: This study established the health literacy level of health science students in Singapore.

Rapid changes in the various areas make the future health system more complex and risky. Therefore, foresight of health sciences is very important. Methods: This futures studies was conducted in 4 steps; also, literature and documents review, statistics and information review, focus group discussions, working group, and scenario planning were used. Causal layered analysis (CLA) was used for data analysis and syntactic as main frameworks. Results: The findings in legal health sciences documents revealed that the value system was not defined clearly and coherently and that logical linkage among myths, discourse, and social structural layers was ambiguous. In trend analysis, 24 trends were recognized; however, political and economic streams were strong, independent, and uncertain factors which created 4 main scenarios although the social and environmental factors divided them into 16 subscenario tunnels. Postmodern discourse in probability scenarios will be dominant and science will be understood as tools for generation of wealth. University structure will be decentralized and transformed into similar R & D to join the health industry, and our quantitative growth (articles, disciplines, and students) in health sciences will decrease. Conclusion: If the current trends (probability scenarios) continue, we will move to an undesirable situation. The main challenge in this regard is the lack of a unique and dominant discourse in health sciences based on the Islamic Republic of Iran doctrine. Therefore, in this study, shifting the paradigm by a new approach and discipline in the health sciences is suggested. © Iran University of Medical Sciences.",,Health Sciences

Health science training programs include students who are studying nursing, dentistry, veterinary sciences, medicine, and related fields (including but not limited to physician assistant programs, pharmacy, optometry, clinical social work, and physical/occupational therapy). When caring for health science students, college health professionals need to keep in mind the unique challenges faced by these students, who often find themselves at the intersection of learner and care provider. With this in mind, clinicians should be prepared for additional immunization and screening requirements. Due to their work in clinical and laboratory settings, health science students may be exposed to infectious and chemical hazards, and clinicians should keep this in mind when providing anticipatory guidance as well as when performing postexposure evaluation.

The bibliometric characteristics revealed significant authors, institutions, countries, funding agencies, and citation impact associated with the publications. In addition, we observed five types of ERGMs for network modeling (standard ERGM and its extensions—Bayesian ERGM, temporal ERGM, separable temporal ERGM, and multilevel ERGM). Most studies (80%) used the standard ERGM, which possesses only endogenous and exogenous variables examining either micro- (individual-based) or macro-level (organization-based) collaborations without exploring how the links between individuals and organizations contribute to the overall network structure. Our findings help researchers (a) understand the extant research landscape of ERGM applications in health sciences, (b) learn to control and predict connection occurrence in a collaborative network, and (c) better design ERGM-applied studies to examine complex relations and social system structure, which is native to professional collaborations. © 2024, The Author(s).",Graph theory; Professional aspects; Social networking (online); Biomedical science; Collaboration network; Collaborative network; Exponential random graph model; Health science; Model application; Network models; Professional collaboration; Social Network Analysis; bibliometrics; controlled study; health science; human; review; social network; social network analysis; statistical analysis; systematic review; Complex networks,Health Sciences

However, significant concerns have arisen due to the lack of research on the public health impact of UNGDO.; Objectives: Environmental Health Sciences Core Centers (EHSCCs), funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), formed a working group to review the literature on the potential public health impact of UNGDO and to make recommendations for needed research.; Discussion: The Inter‑EHSCC Working Group concluded that a potential for water and air pollution exists that might endanger public health, and that the social fabric of communities could be impacted by the rapid emergence of drilling operations. The working group recommends research to inform how potential risks could be mitigated.; Conclusions: Research on exposure and health outcomes related to UNGDO is urgently needed, and community engagement is essential in the design of such studies.

A review of the literature reveals numerous strategies to provide training for health sciences librarians as they provide these new services to health sciences researchers, faculty, and students. With the Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy currently circulating for consultation, it is imperative for Canadian health sciences information professionals to offer RDM services in their libraries. Methods: A review of relevant scholarly articles were collected and analyzed. Initial searches were conducted in the University of Manitoba Libraries’ discovery service, as well as in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Articles were analyzed for skills necessary to provide RDM services and proposed training initiatives to fill RDM skill gaps. Results: After initial searches, 2 142 articles were identified for review. After removing duplicates and articles with only titles and abstracts, 38 articles were selected by analyzing citation counts in Web of Science and Scopus, as well as analyzing selected reference lists. Conclusion: Several suggestions for training are highlighted from the identified articles, including building a national support network, changes to post-secondary library and information studies’ curricula, and offering professional development workshops. However, no consensus emerges with respect to RDM training initiatives. As training initiatives are developed and documented, future studies will verify which initiatives have the greatest success for upskilling information professionals in managing research data in Canadian health sciences libraries. © 2019, Canadian Health Libraries Association.

The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) explains the degree of correlation between variables such as entrepreneurial intention, perceived feasibility and perceived desirability. Knowing the entrepreneurial intention of students of Health Sciences will help to guide and promote effective university policies to support entrepreneurship. The authors aimed to analyse the entrepreneurial intention of university students in the field of Health Sciences. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Faculties of Health Sciences of two public universities of Southern Spain. 1518 students of different degrees of Health Sciences (Physiotherapy, Podiatry, Dentistry, Nursing and Occupational Therapy), from first to fourth year. An online structured questionnaire was used, the Entrepreneurial Event Model (EEM) adapted to the Spanish context. This measurement model was completed with 8 items from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire-MSLQ. Results: The hypothetical model showed that perceived desirability and perceived feasibility were positive and significant predictors of entrepreneurial intention. Perceived desirability showed an indirect effect on entrepreneurial intention through perceived feasibility. Expectation of success and self-efficacy had no direct effect on entrepreneurial intention. Conclusions: Perceived desirability and perceived feasibility are related to entrepreneurial intention in Health Sciences students. © 2022, The Author(s).",Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Intention; Motivation; Self Efficacy; Students; article; cross-sectional study; dentistry; entrepreneurship; expectation; feasibility study; human; human experiment; learning; major clinical study; nursing; occupational therapy; physiotherapy; podiatry; self concept; Spain; structured questionnaire; tertiary education; undergraduate student; university student; behavior; motivation; student,Health Sciences

Human ecology addresses itself not to the interaction of individual man and his situation, but to the relationship between human societies and their natural and cultural environment. Health ecology studies the processes determined by the biotic and social relationship between man and environment and is relevant for health disease and public health care of mankind; it promotes action guided by ecological knowledge.

Some simple explanations to this phenomenon are the intellectual complexity presented by this domain, as well as the dominant industry market share of healthcare. Following in AI's tracks, case-based reasoning (CBR) has been abundantly applied to the health sciences domain and has produced an excellent as well as varied set of publications, which has fostered CBR research innovation to answer some of the research issues associated with this intricate domain. Some notable examples are synergies with other AI methodologies, and in particular with ontologies [8] and with data mining, the study of the temporal dimension in CBR, the processing of multimedia cases, and novel tasks for CBR such as parameter setting. However CBR has a major endeavor to take on in the health sciences: how to position itself with regard to statistics for studying data? Some claim that CBR proposes an alternative viewpoint on the concept of evidence in biomedicine; others that CBR and statistics complement one another in this domain. In any case, an interesting question to study is whether CBR could become one day as fundamental to the health sciences as statistics is today?

In addition, the practices of supplement users in the UAE remain undocumented. Aim: To determine the usage of DS in health sciences and non-health sciences students; and to determine their knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding these supplements. Materials and Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted among university students. Based on the Raosoft online calculator, it was anticipated that the sample of 383 students would enable us to achieve the study objectives. Students were recruited from Ajman University of Science and Technology and identified by the academic staff through students’ records. All students who were registered at Ajman University of Science and Technology – including medical (i.e. dental, pharmacy and health sciences) and non-medical colleges (i.e. engineering, business administration, law, information technology, mass communications and humanities) – were invited to participate, after obtaining the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC), (during the period of January-February 2015). This study used quantitative method approach. Therefore, data were analysed quantitatively using SPSS version 22.0. Results: More than one-third of participants (39%) were found to consume DS. The most common reasons for consuming supplements were to maintain good health (58,21%) and ensure adequate nutrition (43,15%). Almost two-thirds of participants (65%) perceived that the best way to obtain nutrients is through food and DS together (49%), or DS alone (16%). Therefore, there was a relatively high amount of DS intake among participants in this study. With regard to medical and non-medical students’ use of DS, there were no significant differences in the use (p=0.139). However, other findings suggest that there are significant differences in the knowledge of health sciences and non-health sciences students pertaining to the health benefits and safety of these supplements (p<0.001), what they are (p=0.040) and the source of help that should be sought when using them (p<0.001). Conclusion: There is a relatively high prevalence of DS consumption among students, which they reported as using to maintain good health and ensure adequate nutrition. However, findings suggest that there are significant differences in the knowledge of health sciences and non-health sciences students pertaining to the health benefits and safety of these supplements. Therefore, awareness of DS usage and information should be integrated into everyday practice. © 2016, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

At its core, health systems science describes the intricate details required to provide high-quality care to individual patients by assisting them in navigating the multifaceted and often complicated US healthcare delivery system. With advances in technology, informatics, and communication, the modern physician is required to have a strong working knowledge of health systems science to provide effective, low-cost, high-quality care to patients. Medical educators are poised to introduce health systems science concepts alongside the basic science and clinical science courses already being taught in medical school. Because of the common overlap of women's healthcare subject matter with health systems science topics, such as interprofessional collaboration, ethics, advocacy, and quality improvement, women's health medical educators are at the forefront of incorporating health systems science into the current medical school educational model. Here, the authors have described the concept of health systems science and discussed both why and how it should be integrated into the undergraduate medical education curriculum. Medical educators must develop physicians of the future who can not only provide excellent patient care but also actively participate in the advancement and improvement of the healthcare delivery system. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Curriculum; Delivery of Health Care; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Humans; Schools, Medical; Women's Health; adult; article; basic science; curriculum; educational model; ethics; female; health care delivery; health care quality; health care system; human; information science; interprofessional education; medical education; medical ethics; medical school; patient advocacy; patient care; physician; systems science; total quality management; women's health; curriculum; medical education; women's health",Health Sciences

Organizational restructuring and emphasis on cost effectiveness is changing the scope of health science teachers' practical work and their role in healthcare (worldwide). Aim: This study aimed to describe student teachers' perceptions of the competencies needed to work as an educator in the healthcare field. Objective of study was to gain new knowledge which can be used in the development of teacher education programs in nursing science and to define a broader definition of the health science educators. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted. Data were collected from 23 Finnish students completing a master's degree in teaching in the healthcare context using focus group interviews. The data were analyzed by inductive content analysis. Results: The student teachers identified eight main categories of teacher competence: leadership and management competence; evidence-based practice competence; subject competence; ethical competence; pedagogical competence; collaboration competence; internationalization competence; and continuous professional development competence. Conclusion: This study identified essential teacher competencies that can be evaluated among students to develop health science teacher curricula. The findings can be used in follow-up studies or comparative research to investigate competence differences between novice and experienced teachers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd,Adult; Faculty; Female; Finland; Focus Groups; Health Education; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Perception; Qualitative Research; Students; article; clinical article; content analysis; evidence based practice center; Finn (citizen); follow up; human; human experiment; interview; leadership; nursing science; perception; professional development; qualitative research; teacher training; teaching assistent; adult; female; Finland; health education; information processing; male; middle aged; procedures; psychology; qualitative research; student; university,Health Sciences

However, the existing curricula do not have adequate emphasis on global health research and training. This study was carried out to examine health sciences postgraduates' attitudes and practices regarding curriculum for ICT use in global health research and training in China. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among health sciences postgraduates from six universities in southern China, during December 2016 to March 2017. A self-administered online questionnaire was used to collect data through an online survey platform. Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows 13.0. Results: A total of 1065 participants successfully completed the questionnaires. More than 90% of the students have not had any training about ICT, three quarters have not taken an online course, and 31% of the students do not use ICT in their current research. More than 65% thought that, in an ICT research training curriculum, it was important to learn: ICT utilization related knowledge, ICT research methods/resources, knowledge of databases, ways of data use and acquisition, and informatics search methods (ICT users compared to non-users were more likely to agree to these learning components (all p < 0.05)). Many of the respondents used or planned to use mobile phones (80%), Internet (59%), use computer and WeChat (> 40%), and QQ (a popular chat tool in China) (30%) as ICT tools in research activities. ICT users compared to non-users were more likely to consider using ICT and/or biomedical informatics methods in decision-support or support for information seeking, healthcare delivering, academic research, data gathering, and facilitating collaboration (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings of this study showed that ICT utilization was very important to health sciences postgraduates for their research activities in China, but they lacked ICT-related training. The results suggested the need for specialized curriculum related to ICT use in global health research for health sciences postgraduates in China. © 2019 The Author(s).","Adult; Biomedical Research; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Curriculum; Female; Global Health; Humans; Information Technology; Male; Medical Informatics; Students, Health Occupations; Universities; Young Adult; adult; article; cell phone use; China; cross-sectional study; curriculum; data analysis software; decision support system; female; global health; human; human experiment; information science; information seeking; Internet; knowledge base; learning; major clinical study; male; postgraduate student; questionnaire; curriculum; education; global health; health student; information technology; medical informatics; medical research; psychology; university; young adult",Health Sciences

The COVID-19 pandemic context may have serious psychological impacts in this at-risk population. We aimed to assess the self-reported mental health status, health-related quality of life and coping strategies of health sciences students during the early stage of the pandemic. Method: An online 128-item questionnaire sent to 17,673 health sciences students from the Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 in April 2020 assessed: a) sociodemographic characteristics, b) conditions of lockdown, c) depressive (Beck Depression Inventory- Short Form, BDI-SF), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-A, STAI-A) and traumatic symptoms (Impact of Event Scale -Revised, IES-R), d) health-related quality of life (SF12) and e) coping strategies (Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced, Brief COPE). Results: The participation rate was 9.9% (n = 1,765). A total of 19.5% of participants reported an IES-R > 33, 11.6% depressive symptoms, 58.1% anxiety symptoms, and 4.4% suicidal ideation. Their mental health-related quality of life was significantly poorer than for physical health. Female gender, COVID-like symptoms, social isolation due to the lockdown, pandemic-related financial restraint and exams-related stress were significantly associated with poorer self-reported mental health conditions. Volunteering in the healthcare system was significantly associated with lower mental health scores. Coping strategies were mostly oriented toward avoidance and positive appraisal. Conclusion: French health sciences students exhibited high levels of self-reported mental health problems and a poor mental health-related quality of life during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific risk factors related to the pandemic partly explain the observed prevalence. © 2021 L'Encéphale, Paris","Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Depression; Female; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Quality of Life; SARS-CoV-2; Self Report; Stress, Psychological; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; adolescent; adult; anxiety disorder; appraisal (mental function); Article; avoidance behavior; Beck Depression Inventory; Brief COPE Inventory; controlled study; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; dental student; depression; female; financial stress; health care system; health status; health survey; hospital volunteer; human; Impact of Events Scale; lockdown; major clinical study; male; medical student; mental disease; mental health; midwifery student; nursing student; pandemic; pharmacy student; physical therapy student; quality of life; school stress; self report; social isolation; sociodemographics; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; suicidal ideation; university; university student; young adult; anxiety; communicable disease control; coping behavior; epidemiology; mental stress; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; self report; student",Health Sciences

There is a gap in our understanding of the determinants of individual student variation of perceived cost longitudinally in high-effort educational activities within self-selected, context-specific academic domains using the Expectancy-Value framework. At present, an instrument to conduct such research on the motivational dynamics of students who choose to persist in high cost behaviors to achieve mastery in health sciences multi-level simulation-based-games is lacking. Method. In this study, a 10-construct, 46-item Value-Achievement-Cost (VAC) student motivation survey was administered on two separate occasions to 44 12th grade students who had self-selected to participate in a year-long, dual enrollment, health-sciences, Career and Technical Education (CTE) program. The VAC survey was used to measure motivation associated with science in general, health sector science learning, and playing health sciences-related games. Results. Convergent validity was established in five of the ten constructs by comparing the α coefficients of the modified 10-construct, 46-item VAC survey compared to three source instruments previously tested in dissimilar STEM student populations. Internal consistency for each of the 10 VAC survey constructs were strong with α coefficients between 0.82 and 0.90. The VAC survey exhibited reliability between the two administration timepoints with statistically significant nonparametric correlation coefficients in forty-four of the 46-items tested displaying strong monotonic relationships between 0.30 and 0.79. Conclusion. This study has provided the psychometric evidence needed so that the VAC survey can be confidently used to assess cost-related motivational dynamics in longitudinal health science multi-level simulation-based-games. An experimental intervention correlating VAC survey measures with health-science students’ achievement in a simulation-based, multi-level game is proposed. Students’ value, achievement, and cost motivation, related to level achievement, may lead to a better understanding of which health-science game design elements encourage learners to independently persist to mastery. © The Author(s) 2019.",,Health Sciences

The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) is a widely used measure of perceived stress among medical students and healthcare professionals that has not yet been validated among medical and health sciences students in Hong Kong. The aim of this study is to establish the construct validity and reliability of the PSS-10 in this context. Methods: 267 final year medical and health sciences students were surveyed using the PSS-10. The data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis for construct validity and Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and corrected item-total correlations for reliability. Results: Exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure for PSS-10, with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.865 and 0.796, indicating good internal consistency. Corrected item-total correlations showed satisfactory correlation ranged from 0.539 to 0.748 for all items and their respective subscale. Both tests supported PSS-10 as a two-factor scale.

Through this process, it became clear that a formal review of the academic literature would be a helpful base from which libraries could identify new models for their own services. To address this gap, we conducted a scoping review of research services provided in health sciences libraries. Methods: Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, ERIC, CINAHL, LISTA, LISS, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Google for articles that described the development, implementation, or evaluation of one or more research support initiatives in a health sciences library. We identified additional articles by searching reference lists of included studies and canvassing medical library listservs. Results: Our database searches retrieved 7134 records, 4026 after duplicates were removed. Title or abstract screening excluded 3751, with 333 records retained for full-text screening. Seventy-five records were included, reporting on 74 different initiatives. Included studies were published between 1990 and 2017, the majority from North American and academic health sciences libraries. Major services areas reported were the creation of new research support positions, and services for systematic review support, grants, data management, open access, and repositories. Conclusion: This scoping review is the first review of our knowledge to map out research support services provided by health sciences libraries beyond “traditional” library services as well as forms of service evaluation conducted. ©Visintini, Boutet, Manley and Helwig.",Canada; Cinahl; Embase; financial management; health science; human; library; Medline; review; Scopus; systematic review; Web of Science,Health Sciences

This capacity can contribute to improvements in health, social welfare and poverty reduction through domestic application of research findings; it is increasingly seen as critical to pandemic preparedness and response. Developing research infrastructure and performance may reduce national economies’ reliance on primary commodity and agricultural production, as countries strive to develop knowledge-based economies to help drive macroeconomic growth. Yet efforts to date to understand health sciences research capacity are limited to output metrics of journal citations and publications, failing to reflect the complexity of the health sciences research landscape in many settings. Methods: We map and assess current capacity for health sciences research across all 54 countries of Africa by collecting a range of available data. This included structural indicators (research institutions and research funding), process indicators (clinical trial infrastructures, intellectual property rights and regulatory capacities) and output indicators (publications and citations). Results: While there are some countries which perform well across the range of indicators used, for most countries the results are varied—suggesting high relative performance in some indicators, but lower in others. Missing data for key measures of capacity or performance is also a key concern. Taken as a whole, existing data suggest a nuanced view of the current health sciences research landscape on the African continent. Conclusion: Mapping existing data may enable governments and international organizations to identify where gaps in health sciences research capacity lie, particularly in comparison to other countries in the region. It also highlights gaps where more data are needed. These data can help to inform investment priorities and future system needs. © 2021, The Author(s).",Africa; Humans; Pandemics; Research; Africa; article; funding; government; human; international organization; investment; patent; Africa; pandemic; research,Health Sciences

Concurrently, there is an emerging socio-political mobilization to pass legislation that limits the teaching of systemic racism. We argue that teaching and learning about racism in academic health professional curricula often has serious limitations—stagnating in a place of teaching about the social and structural determinants of health, yet emphasizing health education and individual behavioral interventions as solutions to health inequities. We present a framework that explains essential components of antiracist knowledge and action that we argue must be implemented across health sciences curricula. Using this framework, we call on health sciences educators to examine how learners engage with racism as a determinant of health and to make curricular changes that provide opportunities to learn about and engage with antiracist actions. © 2023 Society for Public Health Education.",,Health Sciences

In this paper, current job postings in health science librarianship are examined to investigate whether research data management job duties are being included in advertised health science librarian positions. Methods: Job postings available as of April 5th, 2018 on the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information (iSchool) jobsite were collected and analyzed to identify positions related to health science librarianship. The job responsibilities and descriptions were further examined to identify instances where research data management was mentioned. Results: Thirty-two job descriptions were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Of these thirty-two health science librarian postings, eight included supporting research data management services, in some capacity, as part of the position description. Discussion/Conclusion: Through the job posting analysis, a trend emerged where RDM is not consistently seen as a role for health science librarians. However, the literature indicates that in many instances, research data management is already being done by health science librarians, and is a service which is likely to continue in the future. As such, it is important that research data management roles start being acknowledged and reflected in education and job description opportunities. © 2018, Canadian Health Libraries Association.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Data were collected with a survey questionnaire that was distributed via SurveyMonkey to several health sciences librarian email discussion lists. Results: Out of 176 respondents, 163 reported serving clients from diverse cultural backgrounds. Various services were provided to develop or support initiatives in cultural competency in health professions education and patient care. A considerable number of respondents were unsure or reported no library services to support initiatives in cultural competency, although a majority of respondents perceived the importance of providing culturally competent library services (156, 89.1%) and cultural competency for health sciences librarians (162, 93.1%). Those who self-identified as nonwhites perceived culturally competent services to be more important than whites (p=0.04). Those who spoke another language in addition to English had higher self-rated cultural competency (p=0.01) than those who only spoke English. Conclusions: These findings contribute to our knowledge of the types of library services provided to support cultural competency initiatives and of health sciences librarians’ perceived importance in providing culturally competent library services and cultural competency for health sciences librarians.

Rapid changes in the various areas make the future health system more complex and risky. Therefore, foresight of health sciences is very important. Methods: This futures studies was conducted in 4 steps; also, literature and documents review, statistics and information review, focus group discussions, working group, and scenario planning were used. Causal layered analysis (CLA) was used for data analysis and syntactic as main frameworks. Results: The findings in legal health sciences documents revealed that the value system was not defined clearly and coherently and that logical linkage among myths, discourse, and social structural layers was ambiguous. In trend analysis, 24 trends were recognized; however, political and economic streams were strong, independent, and uncertain factors which created 4 main scenarios although the social and environmental factors divided them into 16 subscenario tunnels. Postmodern discourse in probability scenarios will be dominant and science will be understood as tools for generation of wealth. University structure will be decentralized and transformed into similar R&D to join the health industry, and our quantitative growth (articles, disciplines, and students) in health sciences will decrease. Conclusion: If the current trends (probability scenarios) continue, we will move to an undesirable situation. The main challenge in this regard is the lack of a unique and dominant discourse in health sciences based on the Islamic Republic of Iran doctrine.

Healthcare professionals have the responsibility of providing breastfeeding education to families. Worldwide, most healthcare professionals do not receive sufficient evidence-based education to adequately support breastfeeding families. Objectives: (1) What experiences have university health science students had with breastfeeding? (2) What are university health science students' beliefs and attitudes toward breast and formula feeding of infants? (3) What are the perceptions of university health science students about how other important people in their lives regard breastfeeding? (4) What are the relationships between students' personal experiences with breastfeeding and their beliefs and attitudes about infant feeding choices? Design: A descriptive cross-sectional survey conceptualized using the Theory of Planned Behavior. Setting: The health science college within a major metropolitan research university in the United States. Participants: Health science undergraduate and graduate students (N. = 514), who were over the age of 18 and who were enrolled during the spring of 2011. Methods: Validated survey instruments were used to collect the data on the Theory of Planned Behavior variables. The request for participants was done by emailing all health science students. If students chose to participate, they filled out an anonymous on-line survey. Results: Most participants were not parents; however, the majority of the 95 (21.05%) students who were parents reported their child was breastfed. Significantly more positive attitudes and beliefs were found in graduate students (n. = 101; 20.10%) when compared to undergraduates (n. = 403; 89.9%). Conclusions: Health science students' beliefs and attitudes toward infant nutrition often were not evidence-based.

However, traditional teaching methodologies limit the possibilities for personalized feedback from an instructor and generally do not allow students to achieve the required proficiency levels. Concerning this, technology has been installed as a learning resource with numerous benefits that allow new multidisciplinary lines of research, such as learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM). Both LA and EDM seek to improve educational practice based on the intensive use of educational data, such as analyzing online learning patterns, creating performance predictions, and incorporating artificial intelligence techniques. There is a range of possibilities in applying LA and EDM in teaching procedural skills that have not yet been explored. For this reason, this study aims to answer (1) How the educational data explain the development of procedural skills in virtual environments to support the teaching-learning process in Health Science Education?; and (2) How automatic feedback and adaptive personalization affect the performance and instructional design of the procedural skills learning process of health science students? We expect that this study contributes to the field of technical skills learning mediated by technology in higher education by using the data provided by the interaction of students with virtual resources to support educational decision-making and optimize the teaching and learning processes in HSE. © 2021 ACM.",Decision making; Health; Learning systems; Students; Virtual reality; Adaptative learning; Educational data mining; Health science; Health science education; Learning analytic; Personalized feedback; Procedural skill; Science education; Teaching methodologies; Technical skills; Data mining,Health Sciences

Methods: Based on the results of a needs assessment, a virtual medical library was created; various levels of training were provided. Virtual library users were asked to complete a Likert-type survey, which included questions on intent of use and impact of use. At the conclusion of the project period, structured interviews were conducted. Results: Impact of the virtual health sciences library showed a strong correlation with the impact of information provided by health sciences librarians. Both interventions resulted in avoidance of adverse health events. Data collected from the structured interviews confirmed the perceived value of the virtual library. Conclusion: While librarians continue to hold a strong position in supporting information access for health care providers, their roles in the information age must begin to move away from providing information toward selecting and organizing knowledge resources and instruction in their use.","Computer User Training; Hospitals, Rural; Humans; Indiana; Internet; Interviews; Libraries, Hospital; Library Science; MEDLARS; Needs Assessment; Personnel, Hospital; Pilot Projects; Research Design; User-Computer Interface; health science; health services research; hospital; human; information center; information retrieval; information service; interview; librarian; library; medical decision making; review; rural area; United States; urban area",Health Sciences

It may help if the professional profile of social science in the health sciences would be higher and if its focus would be more on making useful predictions. Clinical epidemiologists may assume that their discipline includes all relevant methods and that social science is largely based on qualitative research. These perceptions need to be challenged in order to widen the scope of clinical epidemiology and include relevant methods from other sciences.

Conclusion: The ESCS experience is an effort to integrate teaching, research and health care in which we should highlight the concern with the development of the interface with public health policies. However, the institutional environment is complex because ESCS is a higher education institution linked to a state Health Secretariat, which supports the full development of the critical, creative and humanistic potential of professors and students.

Although the development of educational standards follows a rigorous consensus approach, they are socially constructed and could result in varied interpretations by users. Reports of varied implementation of standards in health professions education underscore the need to test the developed standards for scaffolding in health sciences programmes. Usability entails determining whether a product like standards works as intended under the expected conditions and contexts. This study aimed to describe the usability of standards for scaffolding in a health sciences programme through a pilot study. Methods: A multi-method design employing user and expert-based usability evaluation techniques sought to describe the usability of the standards for scaffolding in a three-year pre-registration nursing programme. The user sample of nurse educators drawn from the programme, conducted a self-assessment on scaffolding practices in the programme using a developed standards checklist. For the expert sample, three-panel members with an understanding of the discipline and programme context were purposively sampled. These panelists studied the users’ self-assessment reports before completing an author-generated heuristics checklist to support or refute any of the standards. Descriptive statistics, comparative and content analysis were applied to analyse data from users’ interviews and expert’s completed heuristics checklist, determining the standards’ usability, and identifying the usability flaws or strengths. Results: The users had three or more years of teaching experience in the competency-based curriculum for nursing. The experts shared an average of 16 years of experience in teaching in higher education, and seven years of experience in quality assurance and programme accreditation. The four standards had a usability score of above average (68%). Seven usability strengths and four usability flaws were identified. Usability flaws related to misinterpretation of some criteria statements and terminologies, multiple meanings, and users’ challenges in generating evidence for some criteria. Conclusions: The pilot study revealed the context-based ‘truth’ regarding the fidelity of a health sciences programme evaluation on scaffolding, as well as identifying the ideal contextual conditions in which the standards for scaffolding health sciences programmes would work best. The identified usability flaws highlighted the need for further revisions of the standards. Future research on the feasibility of the standards in other health sciences programmes and contexts is recommended. © The Author(s) 2024.",accreditation; adult; article; checklist; consensus; content analysis; controlled study; curriculum; feasibility study; female; health science; heuristics; human; interview; medical profession; nurse; pilot study; program evaluation; quality control; self evaluation; teaching; therapy; usability,Health Sciences

Objective: To assess the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) and its association with internet use for health-related purposes, self-perceived health and health-related behaviour. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of 528 health sciences students. Sociodemographic data, questions related to internet use for health-related purposes, self-perceived health and health-related behaviour, and the eHEALS tool were collected. Results: The overall mean eHEALS score was 3.19 ± 0.78. Students who consider access to health resources on the internet to be very important had the highest eHEALS scores (p = 0.015). There were significant differences between the participants’ perceptions of the usefulness of the internet with regard to making health decisions (p < 0.001), the accuracy of information on the internet (p = 0.001) and the eHEALS scores. Conclusions: Health sciences students have a moderate level of eHealth literacy. Positive attitude towards internet use and positive self-perception of health are the most relevant factors associated with eHealth literacy.

Along the lines of Big Ideas of mathematics [4] we propose a set of “Big Ideas” of mathematical logic relevant to education: for instance, the notion of truth relative to a structure, construction of models for a set of sentences, consistency of procedures used for computation, comparison of algorithms, and so on.

Mathematics anxiety was composed of two facets, one associated with evaluations and the other for learning more generally. Girls had higher mathematics anxiety for evaluations than did boys (ds = -.30 to -.52), but not for mathematics learning. In sixth grade, the negative correlation between mathematical competence and mathematics anxiety for evaluations was stronger in girls than in boys. Longitudinally, higher mathematical competence in sixth grade was associated with lower mathematics anxiety for evaluations and better mathematics attitudes in seventh grade for girls but not for boys. The key finding is that adolescent girls' mathematics anxiety and their attitudes toward mathematics are more reflective of their actual mathematical competence than they are for boys.

Indeed, several mathematicians and philosophers think that mathematics does not depend on experience, and this is also the view of mainstream philosophy of mathematics. However, this view has had a deleterious effect on the philosophy of mathematics. This article argues that, in fact, the view is not valid.

The sub-constructs of these three affective constructs are as follows: (a) (i) amotivation, (ii) external regulation, (iii) introjection, (iv) identification, (v) intrinsic motivation; (b) (i) enjoyment of mathematics, (ii) self-confidence in mathematics, (iii) perceived value of mathematics; (c) (i) anxiety with mathematics and (ii) ease with mathematics. This study identifies, both within and across these three affective variables, the key sub-constructs that educators should focus upon when selecting learning process variables for mathematics achievement. Results were analysed using a series of stepwise regression analyses using data from 1018 Grade 12 students enrolled in a top pre-tertiary institution in Singapore, both for concurrent and predictive relationships, and also for both genders. Results of this study showed that after taking into account self-confidence in mathematics and ease with mathematics, all other sub-constructs of mathematics motivation, attitudes and anxiety were not significantly correlated with mathematics achievement. This is true for both concurrent and predictive relationships, and for both genders. Implications of the results of this study are twofold. First, results of this study provide educators with priority affective variables to focus upon in their efforts to enhance performance in mathematics via the affective domain. Second, in situations where administration time is limited, it may be possible to consider only self-confidence and ease with mathematics when investigating relationships between affect and mathematics achievement. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",,Mathematics

Data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. The study shows that club learners’ school results improved relative to non-club learners, that learners’ experiences of mathematics in club and class were very different from each other and that the club supported different relationships with mathematics than learners experienced in class.

As a result, the educational rationale for and purpose of the course may be vague both to instructors and students. The purpose of this study is to examine the origins of liberal arts mathematics. Its precursor courses emerged as early as the 1930s in response to discontent with the traditional ""freshman"" mathematics courses, a discontent arising from both sociological factors and developments in educational psychology. In committees and on the pages of the mathematics education literature, educators promoted different solutions to the problem of how to better serve the mathematical needs of the general college student. These divergent and at times competing visions of a new course manifested in the mathematical ""survey"" course, and eventually in the course known today as liberal arts mathematics.

The results showed that the obstacles of mathematics teachers in the digital era in implementing technology in mathematics teaching-learning included: (1) mathematics learning material that was less suitable for the use of technology; (2) facilities, infrastructure, and support provided by schools were inadequate for the use of technology in teaching-learning; (3) the level of teacher skills in using technology in mathematics teaching-learning. Some factors that influenced the emergence of these obstacles include (1) teachers assessments and point of views of the effectiveness in using technology in teaching-learning mathematics in the classroom; (2) unequal access to education services between schools in cities and villages; and (3) lack of training and information provided to the teachers about the use of technology in mathematics classes. Those obstacles obtained were common obstacles experienced by the teachers in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, both in urban and rural environments. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",E-learning; Education computing; Personnel training; Set theory; Surveys; Case study research; Junior high schools; Learning Mathematics; Mathematics education; Mathematics learning; Mathematics teacher; Mathematics teachings; Teaching-learning; Engineering education,Mathematics

Although this choice arguably involves the most sizeable instance of choice in the current English school mathematics curriculum, and it has a significant impact on students' post-compulsory study of mathematics, it is not well understood how this choice is navigated. This article explores how mathematics teachers perceive each of these three areas of applied mathematics, how widely each of the modules is offered and in what ways perception might be connected to provision. Data from an online questionnaire and follow-up interviews demonstrate that teachers are influenced by a wide range of factors, including strategic concerns and views on the relative worth of each strand. The results also highlight the presence of inertia in centres' provision. In this way, this article offers some insight into current perception and provision of applied mathematics in England, and speaks to contemporary debates about curriculum content and reform. It argues that students' exposure to the powerful utility of mathematics is often unhelpfully steered or limited at a critical point in their education. © The Author 2012.

Most children viewed mathematics as heavily focused on low-level mathematics operations and as learned and used primarily in school. Older children showed more awareness of mathematics as part of daily living, but still viewed mathematics as mostly school-based—more so than their younger counterparts. Results suggest that awareness of mathematics in daily life may be associated with children’s mathematics utility value (perceived usefulness of mathematics). Although children engaged in activities at home with the potential to foster mathematics development, the frequency of engagement was not related to their awareness of mathematics in daily activities. Thus, there may be untapped opportunities for young children to connect the mathematics they learn in school to their daily life. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Mathematics

The present study aimed to identify mathematics self-belief profiles (derived from combinations of mathematics self-efficacy and mathematics anxiety) and their relationships to mathematics achievement in a sample of secondary-school students. The participants were 2,365 students who completed a self-report instrument for the assessment of mathematics self-efficacy and mathematics anxiety. A latent profile analysis was conducted to identify the participants’ mathematics self-belief profiles. The relationship between the profiles, mathematics achievement, gender and school year, was determined. Six student profiles were identified based on combined levels of mathematics self-efficacy and mathematics anxiety. Specifically, three patterns were found based on the combination of low, medium-low and high levels of mathematics self-efficacy with mathematics anxiety. While the detected profiles indicated statistically significant differences in the explanation of mathematics achievement, gender and school year were not relevant to the relationship between mathematics self-belief profiles and mathematics achievement.

As data collection tools, ""beliefs about the nature of mathematics"", ""beliefs about mathematics learning"" and ""beliefs about the achievement in mathematics"" scales which were developed in TEDS-M study and contain a total of five factors were used. The collected data were analyzed to descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA test using SPSS packet software. The findings indicated that PEMTs commonly have dynamic views toward nature of mathematics in the context of universities and regions. However, the static view representing the traditional aspect of mathematics also had a reasonably high percentile. Significant differences among universities and regions were determined in terms of beliefs about nature of mathematics, learning mathematics and mathematics achievement. To identify the possible reasons of the differences, it is suggested to carry out in-depth qualitative investigations to examine the variables such as courses and their contents, classroom applications in education faculties on the basis of universities and regions. © 2018 Turkish Education Association.

Initially, parents of preschool children (Mage = 3;11 [years;months]) completed a questionnaire indexing parental mathematics anxiety and attitudes and the frequency of preschool home number experiences. The children completed mathematics assessments in their first year (n = 231, Mage = 5;2) and second year (n = 119, Mage = 6;3) of schooling and a mathematics anxiety questionnaire in their third year of schooling (n = 119, Mage = 6;7). A questionnaire indexing the frequency of primary school home number experiences was completed by 119 of the parents in their children's second year of schooling (Mage = 6;0). All indices of parental mathematics anxiety and attitudes predicted children's mathematics attainment in their first school year. These associations were independent of parental mathematics attainment and were not mediated by the frequency of preschool home number experiences. Furthermore, the positive association between preschool home number experiences and children's mathematics attainment was not weaker in the context of high parental mathematics anxiety or negative parental mathematics attitudes. One index of parental mathematics attitudes predicted children's mathematics attainment in their second school year, but this association was not significant when prior attainment was controlled. There was a stronger association between maternal mathematics anxiety and girls’ attainment versus boys’ attainment. Parental mathematics anxiety did not predict children's mathematics anxiety. The findings suggest that children whose parents have high mathematics anxiety or negative mathematics attitudes are more likely to have lower mathematics attainment in their first year of school. However, the mechanism underpinning this association is not yet established. © 2023 The Authors","Anxiety; Attitude; Child; Child, Preschool; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Male; Mathematics; Parents; article; child; controlled study; female; human; learning environment; major clinical study; male; math anxiety; mental capacity; primary school; questionnaire; anxiety; attitude; child parent relation; educational status; mathematics; preschool child",Mathematics

However, there has been less attention focused on pre-service teachers' anxieties about teaching mathematics in classroom settings. This study analyzed pre-service teachers' reflections at the conclusion of an elementary mathematics field experience in order to determine common themes surrounding anxiety-related events based on mathematics practice-teaching experiences. Through qualitative analysis of pre-service teachers' reflections using open and axial coding, three categories and ten themes surrounding elementary pre-service teachers' anxiety-related events based on mathematics practice-teaching experiences emerged. Some of the themes presented were ones that increased pre-service teachers' anxieties for teaching mathematics, whereas other themes reflected aspects of the field experience that decreased anxiety for teaching mathematics. Based on the themes revealed in this study, suggestions for strategies and materials that could be developed for university mathematics methods courses are discussed. Novel perspectives for considering mathematics teaching anxiety, such as locus of control and future time perspective, are shared. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,Mathematics

However, inconsistent and some even contradictory results have been reported in recent studies which examined the associations between growth mindset and mathematics achievements, suggesting the complexity regarding the effects of growth mindset on academic achievements. Methods: This study aims to examine students' growth mindsets, failure attributions, intrinsic motivation, mathematics self-efficacy, mathematics anxiety and mathematics achievements in one model to capture the sophisticated functioning processes of growth mindset. A total number of 266 middle school students in China participated in this study. Students' mindset and related variables (i.e.,motivations to learn mathematics, attributions of failure in mathematics, mathematics anxiety, mathematics self-efficacy) were measured at year 7, the first year of junior middle school in China. These students' mathematics learning outcomes were tracked from year 7 to year 9, the end of junior middle school. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relations among students' growth mindsets, failure attributions, intrinsic motivation, mathematics self-efficacy, mathematics anxiety and mathematics achievements. Results: The results show that: (1) growth mindset doesn't directly predict mathematics achievements; (2) growth mindset indirectly influences mathematics achievements through intrinsic motivation; (3) failure attributions and mathematics self-efficacy sequentially mediate the association between growth mindset mathematics achievements; (4) failure attributions and mathematics anxiety sequentially mediate the relationship between growth mindset mathematics achievements. Discussion: The results of this study contribute a better understanding about how growth mindsets make impacts on middle school students' mathematics achievements. These findings have important implications for mathematics education in that we could not simply cultivate students' growth mindset in schools with expectations of higher mathematics learning outcomes. Instead, along with the growth mindset intervention, it is fundamental to make interventions on students' intrinsic motivation, failure attribution, mathematics self-efficacy, and mathematics anxiety in mathematics teaching and learning.

More specifically, we examined how sixth-grade students’ (N = 146) mathematics self-concept and individual interest changed over one school year, how these changes were related to each other and to mathematics achievement, and, most importantly, whether they differed between co-teaching and solo-teaching conditions. The co-teaching condition included 70 students in three classes with mathematics taught by pairs of teachers, while the solo-teaching condition included 76 students in four classes with mathematics taught by individual class teachers. The design included three repeated measures of mathematics self-concept and interest as well as pre- and post-measures of mathematics test performance and teacher-rated mathematics grades. A series of latent growth curve analyses showed both self-concept and individual interest to decline over time, and these changes to be strongly correlated: as self-concept decreased, so did interest, and vice versa. The changes in self-concept and interest were independent of prior achievement and did not predict later achievement either. Students in the co-taught group received better grades at the end of the year, but no differences in the development of self-concept and individual interest were found between the teaching conditions. That is, co-teaching contributed to improvement in mathematics achievement, but this was not mediated by changes in mathematics motivation. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Mathematics

Here, mathematics is defined by how we collectively talk about it. Drawing on psychoanalytic theory, the student is seen as participating in the renewal of mathematics through their contributions to our collective gaze on mathematics as the field responds to ever new demands. As such learning takes a critical stance on the standard initiations into current practices often promoted by formal education. In the field of mathematics education, researchers have moved from psychology where individual students were seen as following natural paths of development through existing mathematical knowledge, to socio-cultural models predicated on students being initiated into the human world and understood through the reflective gazes this world has of itself, such as those found in comparisons of student learning in different countries. This book addresses the domain, purpose and functioning of contemporary research in mathematics education and is an original contribution to this theme. The book is aimed at a mathematics education research audience. It continues a dialogue with existing publications, seen widely as a cutting edge and will also be of interest to students and practitioners in the fields of qualitative research, social theory and psychology. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

We conducted paired samples t-tests and descriptive analysis to examine the scaled-response questionnaire data and used an open coding process to analyse the open-response survey data. We found that the PSTs significantly improved their mathematics teaching self-efficacy throughout the methods course; and identified five practices that contributed most to the development of self-efficacy and growth mindset in teaching mathematics, which included inductive teaching, differentiation, supporting productive struggle, problem solving, and probing thinking questions.

Thus, this study investigated a young child’s mathematical activity and beliefs prior to school using a framework reflecting a view of mathematics as cultural activity. Through the case study of Olivia, aged 3 and 9 months, we found that her early beliefs about mathematics did not reflect her rich mathematical activity. Although Olivia engaged in a diverse range of mathematical activity (counting, measuring, designing, playing, locating, and explaining), what she believed mathematics to be was constrained to writing numbers and letters. To help young children perceive their own activity as mathematical, we argue there is a need: (a) for researchers, parents, teachers, and teacher educators to recognize the range of mathematics in children’s everyday activities; (b) to explicitly tell children when their activity includes mathematics; and (c) for teacher educators to emphasize the cultural nature of early mathematical experiences and how to capitalize on these experiences. © The Author(s) 2015.",,Mathematics

However, there is a degree of inconsistency in the findings regarding this relationship. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the profiles of students' attitudes toward mathematics and examine their relationship with mathematics achievement. Using latent profile analysis, we examined data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study conducted in Singapore in 2019. We identified four profiles of attitudes toward mathematics, namely very negative (5.44%), negative (41.38%), neutral (38.77%), and positive (14.41%). We also confirmed the literature describing students' attitude toward mathematics as a multidimensionally integrated construct, comprising 'like mathematics,' 'value mathematics,' and 'confidence in mathematics.' Moreover, we discovered a positive relationship between students' attitudes toward mathematics and mathematics achievement. These results showed that the following students are more likely to have high mathematics achievement: (a) those who like to study mathematics and pursue mathematics-related activities, (b) those who believe that learning mathematics will result in a positive outcome (e.g., success in school and job opportunities), and (c) those who trust in their mathematical abilities. Therefore, educators need to examine students' attitudes toward mathematics and provide appropriate support to stimulate the development of a positive attitude toward mathematics.  © 2021 by the authors; licensee Asian Online Journal Publishing Group.",,Mathematics

Kafka’s work), a minority mathematics is not something that exists entirely outside a major mathematics, to be distinguished here from a majority mathematics. Instead, it is a mathematics that, while still exterior to the major mathematics to which it juxtaposes, constructs itself within and even at the very core of this major mathematics. This may be seen as merely a special form of revolutionary vis-à-vis normal mathematical practice in T. Kuhn’s sense. I shall argue, however, by using the work of N. H. Abel, É. Galois, E. Noether, and A. Grothendieck, as my main cases, that this “special” type of revolutionary practice is the primary and even the only form of revolutionary practice possible in mathematics. I designate this mathematics Abelian mathematics, the term commonly associated with formal mathematical properties (such as commutative group or abelian categories), because Abel’s work was, arguably, the first manifested case of a minority mathematics in this sense in modern mathematics. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",,Mathematics

Thus, it is important to identify predictors of mathematics achievement in high school students. Some previous research has shown that students' beliefs and attitudes are important predictors of their mathematics grades and achievement. In the present paper, we examined the ability of mathematics beliefs and attitudes to predict ACT mathematics test scores by analyzing data from a questionnaire designed using the Theory of Planned Behavior framework given to high school juniors and seniors who had recently taken the ACT. Results revealed that mathematics attitudes, subjective norms, perceived control, and intentions were all significantly correlated with mathematics course grades and ACT mathematics scores. Attitudes also incrementally predicted ACT mathematics scores over several key variables.

Role identities, such as having amathematics identity, as well as mathematics efficacy and interest are hypothesized to be important motivators of role-related behavior. Using a structural equation modeling approach, measures of these constructs at grades 9 and 11 are related to grade 12 NAEP mathematics achievement, simultaneously taking into account grade 9 mathematics achievement, high school mathematics coursetaking, educational expectations at grades 9 and 11 and student and school background factors. The results indicate that a mathematics identity and educational expectations at grade 11 are statistically and substantively significant predictors of grade 12 mathematics achievement in the presence of these other factors, whereas neither of the other two motivation factors-grade 11 mathematics self-efficacy and mathematics interest-were shown to have direct effects on grade 12 mathematics achievement.

Through a partnership with secondary teachers, the MINDSET project staff has created a ground-breaking new mathematics curriculum for fourth-year high school students using mathematical-based decision-making tools from the fields of operations research and industrial engineering. High school students are presented a series of real-world problem contexts with the purpose of making the underlying mathematics more relevant to them and allowing them to model the situations and actively do mathematics. This innovative new integration of mathematics and engineering at the high school level provides new opportunities for students, who have not been successful in the abstract world of mathematics, to learn to enjoy and to want to pursue a more applied form of mathematics.

Without these skills, students find it difficult to solve real-life problems. In this regard, researchers have been interested in the efficacy of problem-solving lessons because problem-solving is a major focus in mathematics education. International assessments such as Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) that test students' problem-solving skills lead to benchmarking studies of problem-solving aspects with countries that have achieved outstanding results. This is a comparative study between Malaysia and South Korea on teaching mathematics problem-solving in secondary schools. A total of 51 South Korean mathematics teachers and 71 Malaysian mathematics teachers were involved in the study. These respondents participated in a survey, and three mathematics teachers from each country were interviewed to gain deeper insights into their teaching of mathematics problem-solving. Questionnaire and interview protocols were used as instruments in this study. The findings show many similarities in the teaching approaches for both countries. Malaysian and South Korean teachers use open-ended and students' daily life problems when teaching problem-solving skills in mathematics classes. Although the teachers use mathematics problems in textbooks or reference books, the level of difficulty in mathematics problems in South Korea is higher than in Malaysia. On top of that, the South Korean Ministry of Education has been focusing on problem-solving in mathematics much longer than the Malaysian curriculum, which began it the 6th curriculum. © 2019 IEEE.",Curricula; Engineering education; Surveys; International students; Interview protocols; Level of difficulties; Mathematics education; Mathematics learning; Mathematics teacher; Ministry of Education; Problem solving skills; Students,Mathematics

An analysis of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 data on mathematics performance for secondary school students in Qatar was undertaken. This data includes information on student anxiety and gender among other student and school factors that may potentially impact learning outcomes in the form of mathematics test scores. Results indicate a negative statistically significant relationship between mathematics anxiety and mathematics test scores. This inverse relationship was supported after adjustment was made for other factors that may also potentially affect mathematics performance, indicating lower mathematics scores, on average, among anxious students. It is hypothesised that an attributing factor to the observed association between mathematics anxiety and mathematics performance may be the teaching strategies used that may not adequately attend to the cognitive and psychological needs of students. The degree to which teaching strategies implemented attend to the cognitive and psychological needs of students is a potential area that could be targeted to help improve learning outcomes among students studying mathematics at secondary school. This study assesses the efficacy of various teaching approaches and comparatively assesses their impact on mathematic performance in relation to anxiety levels among students. The implications of this research on suggestions for potential changes to current teaching strategies to acknowledge the potential impact that mathematics anxiety has on outcomes in mathematics is discussed. It is proposed that teaching strategies in Qatar could potentially be reviewed with a view to better cater to the needs of students who are quite anxious about studying mathematics, in an attempt to improve the performance of students nationally as, at present, mathematics performance of students in Qatar is considerably lower than global average standards. Although the average mathematics scores were not significantly different between male and female students, it was observed that males were significantly more anxious compared with females. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

Our strategy is to frame current narratives of mathematics from a virtue-theoretic perspective.

The factor structures and reliabilities (i.e., confidence and the like mathematics scales) were affected by negatively worded items. Second, the relationships between the constructs, achievements and background variables such as parental education, gender and students’ educational aspirations were investigated. We identified several significant relationships between self-belief and mathematics achievement. Differences in the latent mean achievement and the motivational construct were similar to those that have been described in the literature as “paradoxical” and “perplexing”. Nations with high mathematics achievement seem to have students with more negative mathematics self-belief. Some results extend, whereas others refute the findings of previous research. For instance, the relationship between students’ mathematics confidence and mathematics achievement was lower than the relationship between the value of mathematics and achievement in some countries and it was the reverse in others. However, consistent with cultural stereotypes, boys rated their mathematics competence higher than girls. The findings are discussed with reference to implications for cross-cultural research and practice. © 2016, Bofah and Hannula.",,Mathematics

Data were collected through documents and media analysis (lesson plans, students' work, photos, and video) and interview with teachers. The findings showed that both teachers chose to implement the embedded-STEM approach in their first time STEM teaching experience. They used mathematics to facilitate students' problem-solving, mathematics modelling, and reasoning in the STEM project. The teachers had different practices and perspectives in designing, implementing, and assessing embedded-STEM mathematics classrooms. The contribution of this research is to provide practical cases of embedded-STEM mathematics teaching, which may be relevant as a solution for countries that do not offer a specific STEM curriculum. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Curricula; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; High school teachers; Mathematics teacher; Mathematics teachings; Media analysis; Qualitative case studies; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics educations; Teaching experience; Teaching practices; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",Mathematics

Earlier studies in mathematics education revealed that teaching using mathematics games had a positive effect on students’ learning. However, how mathematics games are presented in mathematics textbooks has rarely been systematically examined. In this study, we aimed to investigate how mathematics games are presented in school mathematics textbooks in China. We selected three series of Chinese secondary mathematics textbooks (Grades 7–9) and identified 112 mathematics games in total; then, we coded and analyzed the games according to an analysis framework we established for the study. The results showed that, across the three series of textbooks, the distribution of games was inconsistent and, within the same series of textbooks, it was irregular across the different grade levels; in terms of locations and cognitive objectives, most games were presented as exercise questions and the main purpose was to improve students’ problem solving ability. Moreover, most of the games were single player games and there were slightly more competitive games than non-competitive games. The implications of the findings for the design and research of mathematics games in mathematics textbooks are discussed at the end of the study. © 2023 by the authors.",China; curriculum; education; learning; mathematics; student; teaching; textbook,Mathematics

Based on the control-value theory and developmental dynamic bio-psycho-social model of mathematics anxiety, the present study followed 1796 students from Grades 3 to 6 to investigate the longitudinal associations among perceived teacher support and two conceptually distinct dimensions of mathematics anxiety (i.e., mathematics evaluation anxiety and learning mathematics anxiety). We further explored the potential mediator effects of mathematics learning engagement between perceived teacher support and mathematics anxiety. We found bidirectional longitudinal associations between teacher support and learning mathematics anxiety from grade 3 to grade 6, as well as unidirectional longitudinal associations between teacher support and mathematics evaluation anxiety (from mathematics evaluation anxiety to teacher support). Furthermore, mathematics learning engagement mediated the relation between perceived teacher support and mathematics anxiety (including learning mathematics anxiety and mathematics evaluation anxiety).

In this synthesis, we examined 22 studies about mathematics writing to determine the overall mathematics-writing and mathematics outcomes of mathematics-writing instruction, the mathematics-writing and mathematics outcomes based on study and instructional features, the methods used within mathematics-writing instruction, and the methods used within studies involving students with mathematics difficulty (MD). We conducted a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed studies, published since 2000, focused on instruction in mathematics writing in Kindergarten through Grade 12. We included studies with and without students with MD. Results demonstrated positive student outcomes for mathematics-writing instruction. Furthermore, instructional methods for mathematics writing frequently aligned with practices used for mathematics instruction and writing instruction. Although we identified positive outcomes related to mathematics-writing instruction, and we would recommend for practitioners to provide instruction in mathematics writing, results should be interpreted with caution. Additional high-quality research on mathematics-writing instruction is needed to verify and extend on the results from this synthesis. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",,Mathematics

In line with this, the study also identified the extent to which mathematics is seen as a social construct in textbooks. To achieve these four mathematics textbooks from Grades 9 to Grade 12 were selected for this purpose. The document review method used to determine the extent of use of elements of the history of mathematics, the stage in the unit it used, and the learning domains of mathematics it covered in these textbooks are considered. For document analysis purposes Erdoğan et al.’s (2015) classification of elements of the history of mathematics was adopted. This distribution involves historical notes, notes on usage areas of mathematics, applications with historical notes, and historical elements in students’ extracurricular activities. The result has indicated that it has found 26 elements of the history of mathematics and the highest number found in the grade 11 Mathematics textbook. The learning domain algebra in the form of historical notes also received the highest coverage than others. Moreover, the result has indicated most elements of the history of mathematics were used at the beginning stage of the unit. Finally, the study has concluded that elements of the history of mathematics are not sufficiently integrated with the contents of mathematics textbooks. Several elements of the history of mathematics are far from the social context of the learner, as indicated in the textbooks. © 2023 The Author(s).

Even when in the 1990s the world was moving towards including applications in school mathematics, Russian students continued to engage in pure mathematics learning in their mathematics classrooms. It was physics teachers’ responsibility to teach applications of mathematics; therefore, physics courses were highly mathematics-intensive, making extensive use of mathematics from algebra to calculus in the formulation of scientific laws and the investigation of their consequences.

The suggested picture not so much gives a “screenshot”, as pretends to outline the key trends in the European cultural history from antiquity to our time. It enables to grasp and assess properly the very image (rather the competing images) of mathematics that shapes (shape) the way in which this epistemic field is perceived at present. The two-faced Janus metaphor stresses the fundamental duality of the images in question that can be traced from the opposite intentions of Plato and Aristotle in their philosophy of mathematics to the difference in treatment mathematics receives in Quentin Meillassoux and Graham Harman. The discussion is centered around the emergence of “pure” mathematics in the 19th century and the shaping of its image as a new “secular” metaphysics (or theology) which is still with us. Concurrent with the rise of “pure” mathematics, the concept of “mixed” mathematics was supplanted by the one of “applied” mathematics. Now we are seemed to witness the reverse trend towards restoration, mutatis mutandis, of the “mixed” mathematics point of view which dominated the 18th century. The one major difference with the 18th century situation is the retention of the “freedom” of mathematical investigation gained in the 19th century. The second difference is a new type of alliance with technology, this time the computer one. The analysis of the images of mathematics in this paper is done mostly on the basis of statements of their views by mathematicians and physicists, as well as historians of science; the historical transformation of our conception of the inner structure of mathematics and its place within the whole system of sciences was also of great help. © 2023, Gaidar Institute Press.

Inspired by an information ecology perspective, we investigate how four primary school teachers understand CT in mathematics and how they go ahead to include CT in their mathematics teaching practice. Through observations and interviews, we find promising starting points for including CT, related to pattern recognition, problem solving and the use of programming activities. Our findings indicate that teachers’ lack of knowledge affects CT adoption in two ways: during its inclusion in the existing mathematics curriculum and as a new element focussed on programming and coding, leaving mathematics in the background.

Mathematics anxiety and mathematics teacher efficacy are constructs that are commonly measured in preservice elementary school teachers and are used to help identify future challenges these preservice teachers might have when teaching mathematics. Mathematics teaching anxiety is a relatively new construct measured in preservice elementary school teachers. Mathematics teaching anxiety aims to separate the anxiety experienced when doing mathematics from the anxiety experienced when teaching mathematics. This study used a modified version of an explanatory sequential mixed methods design to examine the relationship between mathematics anxiety, mathematics teaching anxiety, and mathematics teacher efficacy in preservice elementary school teachers in Ontario. Participants were preservice elementary school teachers across six teacher education programs in Ontario. Questionnaire data was gathered from 185 participants, 16 of whom were also interviewed. Results indicate that mathematics teaching anxiety is significantly correlated to both mathematics teacher efficacy and mathematics anxiety, but there was a lack of correlation between mathematics anxiety and mathematics teacher efficacy. These results indicate that mathematics teaching anxiety does interact with mathematics anxiety; however, mathematics teacher efficacy and the introduction of mathematics teaching anxiety may disrupt the previous belief that mathematics anxiety and mathematics teacher efficacy are negatively correlated. Furthermore, interview and short answer responses showed that preservice elementary school teachers who were mathematically anxious were aware of their anxieties and developed methods of overcoming their feelings while maintaining effective teaching practices. © 2022, Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE).",,Mathematics

To address this gap, mathematics achievement, attitudes, and anxiety were longitudinally assessed for 342 (169 boys) adolescents from seventh to ninth grade, inclusive, and latent growth curve models (LGCM) were used to assess the relations among these traits and developmental change in them. Spatial abilities (seventh and eighth grades) and trait anxiety (eighth and ninth grades) were also assessed and used to control for sex differences in these traits. Overall, boys had stronger spatial abilities and more positive mathematics attitudes and were less anxious than girls, but there were no sex differences in mathematics achievement. Across grades, mathematics achievement improved, attitudes became less positive, and anxiety increased for both boys and girls. Higher than average cross-grade growth in mathematics achievement mitigated boys’ developmental declines in mathematics attitudes and increases in anxiety.

Based on the extension cognitive model, this paper discusses how to recognize mathematics teaching from mathematics teaching and how to learn mathematics learning from mathematics learning, thus embodiments the extension thought of metacognitive mathematics education. The experimental results show that children have differences in the ""extension cognition""of mathematics learning, small differences in divergent cognition and related cognition, and large differences in implicative cognition and conjugated cognition. And this difference in ""extension cognition""is determined by many factors, such as children's learning environment, learning thinking habits, parents' behavior thinking mode and so on. Therefore, the key to narrow the differences in primary mathematics education is to improve children's mathematical ""extension cognition""ability.  © 2022 IEEE.",Learning systems; Cognitive difference; Cognitive model; Extension cognition; Mathematics education; Mathematics learning; Mathematics teachings; Metacognitive education; Metacognitives; Primary education; Uncertainty; Computer aided instruction,Mathematics

Further, while gender differences in mathematics self-concept are smaller in more egalitarian countries, both girls and boys have lower mathematics self-concepts and less interest in mathematics careers in these countries.

Educational experts believe that learners can benefit from educational mathematical applications. Senior post-graduate students at the Central University of Technology in South Africa, therefore, embarked on a socio-constructivist project to develop appropriate educational mathematics applications for primary school learners in their community. This paper focuses on the first stage of this project where the aim was to investigate the use of mobile mathematics applications by primary school learners within the South African context. Quantitative and qualitative data was collected by using a survey targeting mathematics teachers and parents of children in grade 1 to 3 in the Free State province of South Africa. The results indicate that 64% of grade 1 to 3 learners have access to mobile devices and that both teachers and parents have a very positive perception towards the use of mathematics applications by their learners and children. In addition 30% of parents have downloaded mobile mathematics applications for learners to use at home. The most important reason why parents are not downloading mobile mathematics applications is because they do not know where to find them, or they do not have time to search for appropriate applications. High costs associated with Internet connectivity and the fact that not all learners have access to mobile devices were two key obstacles mentioned by teachers involved with the use of mobile mathematics applications in primary school education. © 2015 IEEE.",Graduate students; Internet connectivity; Mathematics and science educations; Mathematics education; Mathematics teacher; Mobile Learning; Primary schools; Qualitative data; Students,Mathematics

Two of the factors were interpreted as self-concept-like factors; one representing student’s overall confidence in mathematics labeled mathematics self-concept, and the other labeled generalized mathematics self-efficacy, concerned with student’s future-oriented perception of their competence in mathematics. The other two factors are students’ anxiety when they give wrong answers in mathematics class (in-class anxiety), and students’ anxiety and stress when they must do mathematics homework (assignment anxiety).

To analyse the effects of the intervention, mathematics teaching behavior, mathematics teaching self-efficacy and perceived mathematical knowledge for teaching were measured. Results showed not only the effect of the program on the quality of the dynamic mathematics interviews, but also the effects of the intervention on mathematics teaching behavior, mathematics teaching self-efficacy and mathematical knowledge for teaching. © 2023 Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.",,Mathematics

To improve the studies of mathematics according to the trends in society development, it is necessary to find out the mathematics teaching philosophy as well as to reflect views of the students on the issues of mathematics learning experience and mathematics teaching at university. The structure of mathematical study process for energy and electronics specialties at the RTU and LLU and the survey results, which was carried out at the Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies (LLU) and at the Riga Technical University (RTU), are analysed in this article. The questionnaire includes three diagnostic blocks: the role of mathematics in everyday life; in professional work / in relation to the labour market, and mathematics for the general development of a person. The total sample of the research included 887 cases. The results showed that the RTU students were more confident about their mathematical knowledge. They were ready to apply the acquired knowledge of mathematics in a new context and situation, while students of the LLU had more developed ability to use the acquired knowledge and apply in specific situations. A self-assessment method was used in the study; the results were based on respondents' opinion. Since this was a case study and it only reflects the views of the students who participated in the survey, the results did not provide generalizations, however, the study was conducted to identify problems, to carry out a more in-depth study of them and to search for solutions. © 2018 IADIS Press.

Students wishing to pursue professional engineering degree courses are required to demonstrate proficiency in secondary school mathematics at the higher level. Yet, only a 16% minority of secondary school mathematics students in Ireland takes the Leaving Certificate mathematics exam at the higher level. It is widely thought that mathematics is the ""key academic hurdle"" in producing a supply of engineering graduates [1]. While mathematics has been regarded as a fundamental knowledge area underpinning engineering practice there is a belief among some practising engineers that the mathematics they learned is not applicable to their work [2]. Advances in technology, knowledge diffusion and almost instant information access, support the view that teaching ""engineers to think analytically will be more important than helping them memorise algebra theorems"" [3]. However, research concerning the type of mathematics used by engineers in their work is sparse [2,4]. This research was inspired by the observation that there is a lacuna in the literature concerning the nature of mathematics' role, if any, as a significant cause of the declining number of students entering professional engineering education courses. Additionally there is currently no broad picture of the mathematical expertise required or used by practising engineers. This study investigates (i) the role of mathematics in engineering practice and (ii) whether there is a relationship between students' experiences with school mathematics and their choice of engineering as a career. The population of interest in this study is professional engineers practising in Ireland. A sequential explanatory mixed methods design, where the subsequent collection and analysis of interview data builds on the analysis of survey findings, is employed. Practising engineers' mathematics usage is considered in three parts, namely curriculum mathematics, mathematical thinking, and motivation to take a mathematical approach. Curriculum mathematicsusage is measured by a derivation of de Lange's mathematics assessment pyramid [5]. Mathematical thinkingusage relates to mathematical modes of thinking used in work. Motivation to take a mathematical approach concerns the affective domain whereby it is believed that attitudes, beliefs, values and emotions play a central role in mathematics learning [6]. Engineers' experiences of school mathematics and the impact of their feelings about mathematics on their choice of engineering careers are also investigated. The findings show that (i) engineers' feelings about mathematics are a major influence on their choice of engineering as a career; (ii) teachers, affective factors and sociocultural influences are the main contributors to engineers' interest in and learning of mathematics; (iii) while almost two thirds of engineers use high level curriculum mathematicsin engineering practice, mathematical thinking has a greater relevance to engineers' work compared to curriculum mathematics;(iv) professional engineers' curriculum mathematicsusage is dependent on the interaction of engineering discipline and engineering role, their mathematical thinkingusage is independent of engineering discipline and engineering role; (v) engineers show high affective engagement with mathematics and their usage of mathematics in engineering practice is influenced by the value given to mathematics within their organisation; and (vi) the focus on ""objective"" solutions at the expense of tacit knowledge in mathematics education reduces the value of mathematics in engineering practice.",Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Engineering research; Engineers; Motivation; Students; Teaching; Affect; Engineering careers; Engineering disciplines; Engineering practices; Leaving Certificate mathematics; Mathematical thinking; Mathematics assessments; Professional engineerings; Professional aspects,Mathematics

This case study examined one mathematician's view of the nature of mathematics and his literate practices. Data collected include semi-structured interviews with the mathematician, observations of his daily work routines, and his think-alouds during the reading of a disciplinary text. These data were analyzed qualitatively through an iterative process involving multiple readings and identification and refinement of codes. The analysis revealed that the mathematician (a) viewed mathematics as rigorous and demanding, both theoretical and practical, relatively stable but highly rewarding, interconnected with other disciplines, and involving discipline-legitimated discursive practices; (b) engaged in extensive reading/viewing and writing, valued learning from repeated trials and errors, and collaborated with an international network of peers in research; (c) used a range of reading strategies (e.g. close reading, summarizing, questioning, storying, evaluating, annotating) to help him make sense of the disciplinary text; and (d) marshaled both verbal and visual resources to create specialized knowledge, engage in rigorous reasoning, develop logical argument, and construct professional identity.

In particular, engineering schools are either reducing the number of mathematics courses in degree programmes or engineering staff are teaching mathematics as part of engineering analysis courses. There is also a strong trend in engineering education to make greater use of computer courseware like Mathcad, Matlab and other software systems for the mathematical and statistical components of engineering programmes. Engineer- ing education is undergoing substantial change. The mathematics of engineering programmes will need to change accordingly. Mathematics learning centres have been established in many universities world-wide. Initially their main role was to provide assistance for those who had insufficient levels of competency in pre- requisite mathematics. However, these centres can also make a very useful contribution to the latest trends in the mathematics education of engineering undergraduates.

However, studies of this nature, especially in Africa, are limited, and this poses a challenge to policy development. To cover this gap, the study sought to model the predictive effect of mathematics self-efficacy, motivation for mathematics, and attitude towards mathematics on mathematical creativity from a multidimensional perspective. The study adopted a cross-sectional survey using 654 mathematics students for the study. Two instruments–the mathematics self-efficacy, attitude towards mathematics, and mathematical motivation scales and the mathematical creativity test were used for data analysis after they had undergone a qualitative and quantitatively rigorous validation process. This was done using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis with the average variance extracted and Fornell-Larcker criterion for convergent and divergent analysis, respectively, while Cronbach’s alpha was used to determine the stability of the scales. Analysis was performed using hierarchical regression and the result showed that mathematics self-efficacy and attitude towards mathematics, when taken individually, are the only strong predictors of mathematics creativity from the perspective of fluency, flexibility, and originality components. Collectively, the three predictors were significant in contributing to the variance in mathematics creatively from the three dimensions assessed. However, mathematics self-efficacy was the strongest predictor, followed by attitude towards mathematics. The implications of the study were discussed for policy and curriculum redesign in mathematics education. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

The study was conducted by surveying 54 mathematics teachers in Banda Aceh using a questionnaire based on three perceptual indicators made by researchers, namely cognition, affection, and conation. The data were analyzed by classifying the answers based on perceptual indicators. The results showed that all the teachers had a good perception of mathematics learning by utilizing medical waste management as a learning context. They believe that the context of medical waste management would encourage students to contribute to protecting the environment and foster positive attitudes in students. Nevertheless, some teachers think that the context of medical waste management is a context that is difficult to use in learning mathematics. Also, the teachers are difficult to use medical waste management as a context for learning mathematics and increase their workload. This is due to a lack of knowledge about the use of the context of medical waste management in mathematics learning caused by the limited training on learning mathematics in the context of medical waste management and the unavailability of the teaching materials and learning tools needed, besides requiring more time. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Surveys; Learning context; Learning Mathematics; Mathematics learning; Mathematics teacher; Medical waste management; Positive attitude; Teachers' perceptions; Teaching materials; Waste management",Mathematics

The partnership promotes inquiry-based learning curricula modeled after the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Principles and Standards for School Mathematics. The engineering faculty contribution to the partnership lies in the connection of mathematics to real world applications and to users of mathematics within the framework of an inquiry-based middle school mathematics classroom. The engineering faculty have surveyed many existing science and engineering based problems and activities, both to determine what is available and how our local teachers might use them. A number of resources exist that provide real world examples applicable to middle school mathematics. In some cases these activities are presented in a format that is difficult for teachers to adapt to an inquiry-based pedagogy in a mathematics classroom. Resources are also available that provide application-oriented problems in the form of word problems. These resources provide students with a connection to real world applications in their everyday lives and are supportive of inquiry-based practices. However, our local teachers wanted students to become more engaged in the problems by discovering how the mathematics is used to help solve critical problems in applications of interest. Engineering research and development relies on mathematics and covers many areas of interest for middle school students. Although many wonderful resources are available that provide educators with a connection between engineering, science, mathematics, and real world applications, there is a need for development in support of inquiry-based engineering application tasks for the middle school mathematics classroom. In this paper, available resources for engineering applications in middle school classrooms, inquiry-based pedagogy, and the need for engineering applications supporting inquiry-based mathematics education are presented. Development of the first new application task in this effort and feedback from middle school mathematics teachers are also briefly discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2007.",Curricula; Learning systems; Numerical methods; Problem solving; Standards; Teaching; Engineering applications; Mathematics education; Middle school mathematics partnership; University of Alabama; Engineering education,Mathematics

Data was collected through Knowledge of History of Mathematics Test and Attitudes and Beliefs toward using History of Mathematics in School Mathematics Questionnaire, which was specifically adopted for this study, from 499 students in 6 middle schools in Ankara via clustered-random sampling. The descriptive studies revealed that most of the students stated that history of mathematics was not given a place in their classes and that they did not follow publications related to history of mathematics. On the other hand, the students’ knowledge of history of mathematics was insufficient in general. Their attitudes and beliefs towards the use of history of mathematics in school mathematics were close to positive, but their ideas on this issue did not maturate yet. Two-way analyses of variance indicated significant differences in students’ knowledge of history of mathematics and attitudes and beliefs towards using history of mathematics favoring females and some upper grades. A significant relationship was found between the knowledge and attitudes and beliefs through Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient. © 2016, Hacettepe University, All rights reserved.",,Mathematics

Yet, in addition to cognitive skills, mathematical problem solving also involves affective factors. In the current study, we first investigated effects of mathematics anxiety (MA) and mathematical metacognition on word problem solving (WPS). We tested 224 children (116 boys, M = 10.15 years old, SD = 0.56) with the Mathematics Anxiety Scale for Children, the Chinese Revised-edition Questionnaire of Pupil's Metacognitive Ability in Mathematics, and WPS tasks. The results indicated that mathematical metacognition mediated the effect of MA on WPS after controlling for IQ. Second, we divided the children into four mathematics achievement groups including high achieving (HA), typical achieving (TA), low achieving (LA), and mathematical learning difficulty (MLD). Because mathematical metacognition and MA predicted mathematics achievement, we compared group differences in metacognition and MA with IQ partialled out. The results showed that children with MLD scored lower in self-image and higher in learning mathematics anxiety (LMA) than the TA and HA children, but not in mathematical evaluation anxiety (MEA). MLD children's LMA was also higher than that of their LA counterparts. These results provide insight into factors that may mediate poor WPS performance which emerges under pressure in mathematics. These results also suggest that the anxiety during learning mathematics should be taken into account in mathematical learning difficulty interventions. Copyright: © 2015 Lai et al.

We report the effects of the program on students' specific mathematics skills, as well as uncover which elements of the design of the games could be responsible for gains in achievement. We pay particular attention to the alignment of design features of the games, the standards to which developers intended to align their games, and assessments of specific mathematics skills. Results indicate a statistically significant effect of the program on students' basic number sense skills as measured by a standardized measure of mathematics achievement (effect size of 0.14). Subsequent coding of the games for elements that are related to number sense, such as the occurrence of number lines and objects that represent numbers, revealed that these design elements occur throughout the software.

In this study, we explored how students with MD who participated in a word-problem intervention randomized-control trial performed on a mathematics-writing task. We sampled 144 third-grade students with MD and evaluated student performance on an explanatory mathematics-writing measure. Overall, students with MD, on a mathematics-writing rubric with five categories, scored between 1 and 2 points out of a possible 5 points for each category.

Teachers often change the stipulations in the mathematics curriculum while teaching mathematics in the classroom. Determining the link between teachers' teaching styles and curriculum material requires an integrated analysis of their didactic teaching process in the classroom and their interpretation of learning content. This article refers to the dynamic and constructive relationship between teachers and mathematics textbooks - most teachers refer to the content of mathematics textbooks in their didactic mathematics teaching strategies. The various interpretations of the curriculum suggested by authors of mathematics textbooks and teachers' interpretation of and preferences for curriculum contents and mathematics textbooks have given rise to the listing - by researchers - of three types of curriculums in the field of mathematics tuition, namely: Prescribed curriculum (Department of Education); Intended curriculum (Textbook authors); Implemented curriculum (Teachers). As a result of the different interpretations of the mathematics curriculum by textbook authors and teachers, certain gaps in learners' cognitive development could arise during teaching in the classroom. During the in-service training of mathematics teachers, the researcher observed that they do not know how to align their interpretation of curriculum contents with mathematical tasks, concepts and skills. In the light of the gaps in mathematics teachers' knowledge of how to reconcile and interpret learning contents, the aforementioned gaps are analysed and an attempt is made to find possible solutions to the following: teachers' interpretations of how to bring mathematics curriculum contents into line with their interpretations of the reconciliation found in mathematics textbooks. Arising from the above-mentioned aligned interpretation by teachers, mathematics teaching in the classroom is analysed and evaluated with a view to determining whether learners' cognitive mathematical skills have improved. © Common Ground, Wynand van der Merwe, All Rights Reserved.",,Mathematics

Some higher education providers now offer pathways for these students to pursue mathematics studies up to a major specialization within the bachelor of science programme. This article analyses the performance in and engagement with mathematics of the students who elect to take up this option. Findings indicate that these are not very different when compared to students who enter university with an intermediate mathematics preparation. The biggest contrast in performance and engagement is with those students who have studied mathematics in senior secondary school to an advanced level. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.,,Mathematics

Critical mathematics education enables students to read the world with mathematics. Three emerging domains of mathematics education related to critical mathematics education are discussed in this manuscript: ethnomathematics, equity in mathematics education and culturally responsive teaching. All three of these domains share the purpose of creating just and democratic classrooms while they provide different means to reach this purpose. Ultimately, the goal of the critical mathematics education is to empower students with knowledge, skills and dispositions needed to create democratic communities embracing social justice in and outside of school. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",,Mathematics

Similarly, prior research has noted that prospective elementary teachers (PSTs) may experience such feelings of distress while learning to teach mathematics in their teacher-preparation programs. Mathematics teacher educators have sought to reduce elementary PSTs' mathematics anxiety by improving their mathematical content knowledge and discipline-specific pedagogical knowledge. But why might mathematics anxiety persist even after elementary PSTs have successfully completed such teacher-preparation coursework? Our case study of a female elementary PST, identified as gifted, illustrates how mathematics anxiety, when reinforced by personal narratives that create and reiterate patterns in past mathematics learning, can operate as an enduring identity (e.g., a mathematics-avoidant identity), long after the stressful events prompting that anxiety have ended. Thus, such narrative identities can engender new/similar experiences of anxiety in present and future mathematics learning/teaching and can ultimately influence the educational and professional decision-making of adult PSTs, even though such self-understanding is based in oft-told stories of childhood and adolescence. The influence of mathematics-anxiety identities merits further exploration, as most previous studies of mathematics anxiety have tended not to address the significant identity work that PSTs undertake during professional development.  © 2022 Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.",,Mathematics

As a way of doing mathematics, it revealed itself to value conjectures, tests, generalizations, and demonstrations as its modus operandi; and, as a way of teaching mathematics, it revealed itself idealizing the scientific experience of the construction of knowledge in mathematics for the classroom, conceiving the doing of students and teachers as an imitation, as an act like a mathematician would.

Pure mathematics is viewed as neutral and value free, and therefore free of ethical responsibility. Applications of mathematics are seen as employing a neutral set of tools which, of themselves, are free from social responsibility. However, mathematicians are convinced they know what constitutes good mathematics. Furthermore many pure mathematicians are committed to purism, the ideology that values purity above applications in mathematics, and some historical reasons for this are discussed. MacIntyre’s virtue ethics accommodates both the good mathematician (and good pure mathematics) and the ethics of the social practice of mathematics. It demonstrates that purism is compatible with acknowledging the social responsibility of mathematics. Four aspects of this responsibility are mentioned, two concerning the impact of mathematics via education, and two concerning explicit and implicit applications of mathematics. The last of these opens up the performativity of mathematical and measurement applications in society, which change the very processes they are supposed to measure. Although these applications are not explored in detail, they illustrate the importance of considering the ethics and social responsibility of mathematics in society. MacIntyre’s virtue theory opens a broad approach to the controversial topic of the ethics of mathematics encompassing purism, and absolutist and social constructivist philosophies of mathematics, but still enabling ethical critiques of the impact of mathematics on society. © 2020, The Author(s).",,Mathematics

Amos Software (v. 23) was instrumental in the Modeling analysis computations (SEM: EFA/CFA), and the paths were tested on the hypotheses. Attitude towards mathematics produced a positive impact on learners’ interest, which in turn impacted positively on learners’ perception of mathematics, and technology yielded a positive impact on how learners perceive mathematics.

Thus, there is an urgent need to improve students’ mathematics attitudes because attitudes may negatively affect conceptual understanding of mathematics or mathematics performance. However, without a clear unified construct of mathematics attitudes, the ambiguity surrounding this construct prevents researchers from drawing broad conclusions about how to improve students’ overall mathematics attitudes. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of 95 studies focused on mathematics attitudes to clarify the construct and measurement of mathematics attitudes, and to provide a holistic picture of the relations between mathematics attitudes and math achievement. The review suggested the adoption of a multidimensional definition that regards mathematics attitudes as a combination of specific mathematical cognitions (value, gender roles/beliefs, confidence, self-concept), affects (enjoyment, anxiety), and behavioural intentions (i.e., willingness and tendency to spend more time learning mathematics subjects). The review then explored the relations between each subdimension of attitudes and mathematics performance. In general, anxiety and gender roles were negatively correlated with mathematics performance (r =-.27 to-.48;-.21) whereas enjoyment, self-concept, confidence, perceived value, and behavioural intentions were positively related to achievement (r =.27 to.68;.21 to.76;.34 to.42;.11 to.30;.21 to.34, respectively). Thus, mathematics attitudes appear to comprise three components with several subdimensions that each uniquely contribute to mathematics achievement. Going forward, researchers of mathematics attitudes should a) specify the components of mathematics attitudes used to guide their investigation b) adopt measures in line with their chosen components, and c) investigate how each subdimension of mathematics attitudes uniquely and cumulatively contribute to mathematics ability. © 2022, PsychOpen.

Thematic coding analysis was performed to code the open-ended questions based on the framework of three intersecting values: mathematical values (the discipline), mathematics educational values (the pedagogy), and general educational values (the ethical and moral principles). The findings showed significant mean differences in mathematics educational values between teachers and students. No significant difference was found in mathematical values between teachers and students. Moreover, the qualitative data confirmed the similarities in mathematical values and differences in mathematics educational values between teachers and students.

This study explored the association between mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) and high-risk math test scores of middle school students, which is noticeably slim in the domain of mathematics education, through a mediating process involving math-specific test anxiety and math self-efficacy. Using data from a sample of 45 students, age 12–13, we found empirical support for a significant positive correlation between mindfulness and middle school students' math achievement. Participants listened to a mindfulness audio every other week before a mathematics test. Weekly mathematics test scores, student group discussion data, and in-depth interview data were analyzed to explore how mindfulness affected students' mathematics test performance, which showed a statistically significant improvement after mindfulness compared to mathematics achievement without the intervention. Our results indicate that mindfulness can relieve mathematics anxiety symptoms, including physiological manifestations, test-unrelated thinking and worries, and problem-solving obstacles caused by mathematics anxiety. Also, mindfulness, especially its non-judgmental attitude, positively affects students' mathematical self-efficacy. The current research provides evidence of the mindfulness intervention's efficacy for improving middle school mathematics test performance but also identifies the complexities of implementing it with large numbers of students.

This paper aims at evaluating this story against the background of the contemporary scholarship in the history of mathematics. The conclusion is that it should be considered as a specimen of modern myth-making activity brought to the fore by an unconscious tendency to model the whole history of mathematics on the pattern of the foundational crisis of the first decades of the 20th century. What is more, the consideration of the specific role and character of the foundations in both early Greek mathematics and 18th-century mathematics gives an occasion to raise a more general question regarding the true meaning of the historicity of mathematics. In the first part of this paper, it has been demonstrated that there is no evidence to recognize the so-called “first foundational crisis” in pre-Euclidean Greek mathematics caused by the discovery of incom-mensurable magnitudes. The second part is mainly devoted to the historical situation of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, the alleged epoch of “the second founda-tional crisis” caused by the obscurity of the basic notions of the calculus. Despite the lack of clarity as far as the foundations of mathematical analysis are concerned, there are no signs of a foundational crisis in 18th-century mathematics. On the contrary, in the 19th century, at the time of “the second scientific revolution”, there are striking illustrations of crisis aware-ness. The cultural processes that engendered this awareness are shown to be identical for the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, hence the second and the third founda-tional crises are proved to be the different stages of the same unique crisis. Finally, we have only one foundational crisis instead of three. © 2021, Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.",,Mathematics

In this paper, we will: (a) identify the forces that are acting on contemporary mathematics instruction; (b) examine some of the historical, social, and psychological underpinnings that have given rise to these forces; (c) enumerate the conditions which mathematics instruction must address if it is to remain a viable discipline; and (d) evaluate the relative success of a case study, addressing the role of mathematics instruction for technical career students, that has been designed to address these conditions. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Mathematics

Recently, studies have shown that Mathematics attitude and Mathematics self-efficacy as affective factors, and reading comprehension as a cognitive factor could play a crucial role in the problem-solving of middle school students. This study investigated the influence of reading comprehension skill, Mathematics self-efficacy perception and Mathematics attitude on non-routine Mathematics problem-solving skills. It is hypothesized that non-routine problem-solving skills are related to reading comprehension skills, Mathematics self-efficacy perception and Mathematics attitudes. To achieve this aim, a reading comprehension skill test, a Mathematics self-efficacy perception scale, a Mathematics attitude scale and a non-routine problem-solving skill test were applied. The instruments were completed by 362 middle school students. A correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship of variables on non-routine problem-solving skills, and the predictive effects of the predictor variables on non-routine Mathematics problem-solving skills were examined by hierarchical regression analysis. The analysis also showed that for middle-school students’ non-routine Mathematics problem-solving skills, all related factors–reading comprehension, Mathematics self-efficacy perception and Mathematics attitude were significant. Reading comprehension skills and Mathematics self-efficacy perception significantly predicted problem-solving skills, and both predictors explained a total of 22% of the total variance. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,Mathematics

Mathematics teacher support is crucial for enhancing students’ mathematics feedback literacy. This research aims to analyze the fundamental traits of high school students’ mathematics feedback literacy, examine the connection between their perceived mathematics teacher support and feedback literacy, and explore the influence of mathematics self-efficacy within this context. Methods: The study population consisted of 619 high school students, including freshmen (N = 366; 59.1 %) and sophomores (N = 253; 40.9 %), in the western provinces of China. The instruments used were the Mathematics Feedback Literacy Scale, the Perceived Mathematics Teacher Support Scale, and Mathematics Self-Efficacy Scale. Results: The research uncovered a notable positive correlation between students’ perceived mathematics teacher support (especially affective support and autonomy support) and mathematics feedback literacy, with affective support exhibiting the greatest explanatory capacity. Deeper examinations indicated that mathematics self-efficacy functioned as a pivotal mediator in this connection, particularly in linking affective support to various aspects of mathematics feedback literacy. Conclusion: This research underscores the pivotal role that students’ perceived mathematics teachers support, particularly in terms of affective support, and their mathematics self-efficacy play in fostering their mathematics feedback literacy during high school. The discoveries not only broaden the theoretical scope of research on feedback literacy, but also provide new practical perspectives and strategic recommendations for improving high school students’ mathematics feedback literacy, enhancing mathematics self-efficacy, and ultimately facilitating the development of mathematical learning effectiveness and mathematical thinking skills. © 2024",,Mathematics

With this trend, students find that mathematics is not an abstract subject far removed from reality. One of the pioneers in teaching mathematics to be associated with real-life is Hans Freudenthal-Dutch mathematics educator. He developed the theory of Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) with the idea that teaching mathematics must start a realistic situation; today this theory has been widely applied not only in the Netherlands but also in many parts of the world. In order to approach RME into mathematics education in Vietnam, we developed the RME-based teaching model and conducted research with the teaching of cosine theorem-Geometry 10 to verify its feasibility. The results showed that if the teacher used RME – based teaching, students could learn cosine theorem by abstracting and generalizing from a real situation; thereby, they found that mathematics is very close to life, creating a motivation for learning mathematics for them. From this, we can assert that teaching with the RME approach meets the goal of mathematics education in Vietnam in the present and upcoming period in the 21st century, and it needs to be studied and widely applied in mathematics teaching in Vietnam. © 2020 IJSTR.",,Mathematics

Aim: To examine a moderated mediation model between mathematics anxiety and mathematical calculation, with intelligence as a moderator, and mathematics self-efficacy as a mediator. Methods: A sample of 247 deaf children from 2 special education schools and 247 hearing children (matched in intelligence) from one mainstream school in China completed computerized tests of intelligence and mathematical calculation and self-report questionnaires of mathematics anxiety and mathematics self-efficacy. Simple mediation analyses and moderated mediation analyses were conducted using PROCESS, and a simple slopes method was employed to plot the conditional indirect effects. Results: There was a significant negative correlation between mathematics anxiety and mathematical calculation, and between mathematics anxiety and mathematics self-efficacy in deaf children and hearing children. However, mathematics self-efficacy was positively associated with mathematical calculation in deaf children but not in hearing children, and the significantly negative relationship between mathematics anxiety and intelligence was observed only in deaf children but not in hearing children. Mathematics self-efficacy partially mediated the association between mathematics anxiety and mathematical calculation in deaf children; and the indirect effect between mathematics anxiety and mathematical calculation via mathematics self-efficacy was moderated by intelligence in deaf children but not in hearing children.

We also demonstrate that integrating perspectives from education, psychology and neuroscience contributes to a greater understanding of mathematics anxiety in its state and trait forms. Research from cognitive psychology and neuroscience illustrates the effect of state mathematics anxiety on performance and research from cognitive, social and clinical psychology, and education can be used to conceptualise the origins of trait mathematics anxiety and its impact on avoidant behaviour. We also show that using this transdisciplinary framework to consider state and trait mathematics anxiety separately makes it possible to identify strategies to reduce the negative effects of mathematics anxiety. Implementation of these strategies among particularly vulnerable groups, such as pre-service teachers, could be beneficial. © Australian Council for Educational Research 2016.",,Mathematics

I then consider two types of Mathematics, which I call Cognitive Mathematics and Technical Mathematics respectively. The former type relates to concepts and meanings, logic and sense, whilst the latter relates to algorithms, heuristics, rules and application of various techniques. I claim that an upgrade in the school teaching of Cognitive Mathematics is necessary. The aim is to change the current mentality of the stakeholders so as to compensate for the undue value presently attached to Technical Mathematics, due to advances in technology and its applications, and thus render the two sides of Mathematics equal. Furthermore, I suggest a reorganization/ systematization of School Mathematics into a cognitive network to facilitate students' understanding of the subject. The final goal is the transition from mechanical execution of rules to better understanding and in-depth knowledge of Mathematics. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2006.",,Mathematics

In this paper, as an attempt to reconceptualise students' conceptions of mathematics, the notion of ""the lived space of mathematics learning"" is introduced, referring to the space experienced by learners and spanned by all the dimensions in which problems in mathematics vary from each other, and from non-mathematical problems. This ""lived space"" constrains what the learners will regard as mathematics and as mathematics learning, and constrains therefore their conceptions of mathematics and mathematics learning. Based on this understanding, the present study is aimed at investigating the relationship between students' conceptions of mathematics and how they actually tackle mathematical problems. By using a variety of open-ended non-routine mathematical problems, the extent of variations in students' conceptions of mathematics and in their lived space of mathematics learning were explored. Non-routine mathematics problems as tasks could bring about a sharp contrast with the usual problems in their classroom learning. Students were interviewed after they were asked to attempt several mathematical problems, some being routine and some open-ended. Through a detailed analysis of students' interview protocols, characteristic features of their conceptions of mathematics and mathematics learning have been revealed. These were discussed in terms of the existing classroom teaching and examination culture. It is argued that the present notion of the lived space can also point to ways to broaden students' current narrow conceptions of mathematics. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

In this paper we present an approach based on generic descriptors of mathematics learning objectives. Exploiting live observations in five European countries, the descriptors were developed in a bottom-up recursive manner for application to videotaped lessons from four of these countries, Belgium (Flanders), England, Hungary and Spain. The analyses showed not only that the descriptors were consistently operationalised but also that they facilitated the identification of both similarities and differences in the ways in which teachers conceptualise and present mathematics that resonated with the available literature.

The study investigates (1) what teachers may learn about the nature of the mutual contribution in an academic program that includes university level mathematics courses that offer teachers ample opportunities to learn contemporary and historical mathematical modeling and applications, and (2) what mathematicians, who teach in this program, want to teach teachers about the nature of the mutual contribution. The main data sources included interviews with five mathematicians and 14 secondary school teachers. The results indicate that the mathematicians viewed the mutual contribution between mathematics and other fields as an important component of teachers’ knowledge which they wished to advance, whereas the teachers reported only on considerably advancing their knowledge and appreciation regarding one direction: the contribution of mathematics to other fields.

These metaphors were investigated through a questionnaire with five open-ended items. An inductive analysis of the students’ metaphors for mathematics indicated that students had well developed and complex metaphors about mathematics, mathematics learning, mathematics teaching and the mathematics teacher. Several common themes emerged, including the view that hard work, patience and perseverance are needed for success in mathematics. Some students emphasised their role in learning mathematics as active while others view their role of the teacher as crucial. Three mental images are common: firstly, the notion that mathematics learning is challenging and may involve anxiety; secondly, that perseverance is needed as continuing effort will bring reward; and lastly, that positive or negative mental images of mathematics are related to the perception of and the active vs passive role of the learner. Considering that the metaphors were collected from students with an extensive engagement with mathematics learning, the findings implied that these metaphors reflect the students’ mental images formed as a result of experiencing mathematics learning. © 2014 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE).",,Mathematics

A sample with 8707 fourth-grade primary students and 129 mathematics teachers was analysed. Methods: The multi-level analysis was used in this study with students representing the level-1 units and teachers representing the level-2 units. Results: Based on a large-scale standard assessment and survey in China, this study showed that cognitive activation was positively related to mathematics performance overall.

Malaysia and South Korea emphasise the use of technology in mathematics classes, as stated in their mathematics curriculum. In this regard, this study identifies how teachers integrate ICT and educational technology in mathematics classes in both countries. A questionnaire containing three sections was developed. The first part contains the demographic information of the mathematics teachers, the second part consists of items under the construct of enabling technology with the field-crossing approach as a collaborative medium and a digital tool, and the third part consists of items under the construct of information, media and technological fluency. A total of 71 Malaysian mathematics teachers and 51 South Korean mathematics teachers were involved in the survey. A semi-structured interview was conducted with three mathematics teachers from both countries to collect in-depth information on the use of ICT and educational technology in mathematics classes. The findings show that the use of educational technology in mathematics classes in Malaysia is still low. Mathematics teachers in Malaysia are also behind in applying social media for educational purposes. However, mathematics teachers in Malaysia use ICT resources such as Wikipedia and YouTube to obtain additional information to be used in mathematics classes. While in South Korea, although mathematical education technology has been introduced since the sixth curriculum and classes have been equipped with technological equipment, most teachers do not use it in mathematics classes. However, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) shows that the level of use of educational technology by mathematics teachers in South Korea is still high compared to mathematics teachers in Malaysia. © 2019 IEEE.",Curricula; Digital devices; Educational technology; Engineering education; Information use; Mirrors; Surveys; Demographic information; Enabling technologies; Mathematical educations; Mathematics curricula; Mathematics teacher; Semi structured interviews; Technological equipments; Technological fluency; Set theory,Mathematics

The first aspect is conceptual, which characterizes mathematics as the invention of and working with concepts, rather than only by its logical nature. The second, Pythagorean, aspect is grounded, first, in the interplay of geometry and algebra in modern mathematics, and secondly, in the epistemologically most radical form of modern mathematics, designated in this study as radical Pythagorean mathematics. This form of mathematics is defined by the role of that which beyond the limits of thought in mathematical thinking, or in ancient Greek terms, used in the book’s title, an alogon in the logos of mathematics. The outcome of this investigation is a new philosophical and historical understanding of the nature of modern mathematics and mathematics in general.

Mathematics anxiety comprises negative feelings pertaining to a person’s engagement with mathematics. While much research into mathematics anxiety concentrates on students in second-level and higher education, there has been a paucity of research focusing on mature students learning service mathematics, and particularly in an Irish context. The drive to widen access to undergraduate education means that more and more mature students engage with programmes with obligatory service mathematics courses. The current study employs a quantitative approach to investigate mathematics anxiety among mature students learning service mathematics in Ireland. A survey was administered comprising biographical questions and the Mathematics Anxiety Scale U.K. (MAS-U.K.). The findings demonstrate that mathematics anxiety exists among this cohort, with situations of mathematics evaluation resulting in higher levels of mathematics anxiety.

The sample of parents was obtained at the final stage of national competition of mathematics, commonly called CONAMAT, carried out after of previous stages of classification. The parents were divided in two groups, primary education parents and secondary education parents. The results revealed that the factor more important that influenced on the preference from students for mathematics learning were the vocation from students to sciences and the motivation from students to mathematics.

We argue that for the Zimbabwean secondary school mathematics curriculum to align with the 4IR requirements, it should be transformed rather than reformed. Curriculum transformation focuses on generating new structures, yet reform focuses on existing systems. To transform the Zimbabwean secondary school mathematics curriculum, the following should be integrated into the curriculum: collaboration activities, new literacies, learning factories, and problem-based learning.

In the 1950s the important movement bringing together social sciences and the field of health began, however weak credentials still prevail. This is due to the low professional status of social scientists in health and the ill-defined position of the social sciences professionals in the health field. It is also due to the scant importance attributed by students to the social sciences, the small number of professionals and the colonization of the social sciences by the biomedical culture in the health field. Thus, the professionals of social sciences applied to health are also faced with the need to build an identity, even after six decades of their presence in the field of health. This is because their ambivalent status has established them as a partial, incomplete and virtual presence, requiring a complex survival strategy in the nebulous area between social sciences and health.",Health; Health Personnel; Humans; Social Sciences; Social Theory; education; health; health care personnel; human; sociological theory; sociology,Social Sciences

It analyzes not only the extent of theory use but also what, how and where these theories are used. While 87 different theories are used, less than two percent of papers use a social science theory, most theories are used in only one paper, most social sciences are ignored, and the theories are rarely tested for applicability to software engineering contexts. Ignoring relevant social science theories may (1) under-mine the community's ability to generate, elaborate and maintain a cumulative body of knowledge; and (2) lead to oversimplified mod-els of software engineering phenomena.

Based on the data of China’s humanities and social sciences (CHSS) publications from 2013 to 2018, by using statistical methods, we systematically describe a unique hierarchical structure of CHSS, in which the papers reprinted by three digests belong to the first level, and the papers replicated by the “China Social Science Excellence”( CSSE) are classified as the second level, and the papers indexed by “Chinese Social Science Citation Index” (CSSCI) fall into the third level, and all the papers of CHSS in CNKI belong to the fourth level. Then the features of the hierarchical structure are quantitatively analyzed. We find that the first level papers account for only 0. 21%, of the total papers, and the second level papers account for 0. 66%, while the third level papers account for 4. 9%. We also find that the number of papers reprinted by various institutions fits to the power law and is highly unbalanced; papers indexed by CSSCI journals account for 70% of the high-level reprint; non-CSSCI journals also play a role in the structure; the top-level digests have distinct disciplines preferences for reprinted papers, and the proportion of papers from different disciplines at different schools varies. Meanwhile, the three top-level digests show a great potential in identifying the frontiers and hot spots in each discipline, and each digest has different considerations in terms of theory, practice, and readability. We expect that the results could provide a holistic framework for insight and evaluation of CHSS, so as to better unleash the display function of this hierarchical structure. 6 figs. 6 tabs. 27 refs. © 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

Drawing on Bourdieu's concept of field and Knorr-Cetina's concept of epistemic culture, this study explores the extent to which it is possible for the social sciences to integrate into, and thrive in, a field in which the experimental paradigm occupies a hegemonic position. Thirty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore biomedical scientists' receptiveness toward the social sciences in general and to qualitative research in particular. We found that these respondents exhibited a predominantly negative posture toward the social sciences; however, we also found considerable variation in their judgments and explanations. Eight biomedical scientists tended to be receptive to the social sciences, 7 ambivalent, and 16 unreceptive. The main rationale expressed by receptive respondents is that the legitimacy of a method depends on its capacity to adequately respond to a research question and not on its conformity to the experimental canon. Unreceptive respondents maintained that the social sciences cannot generate valid and reliable results because they are not conducive to the experimental design as a methodological approach. Ambivalent respondents were characterized by their cautiously accepting posture toward the social sciences and, especially, by their reservations about qualitative methods. Based on the biomedical scientists' limited receptiveness, we can anticipate that the growth of the social sciences will continue to meet obstacles within the health research field in the near future in Canada. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Studying this impact leads to a better appreciation of the role of instructors who teach the humanities and social sciences course in improving the teaching-learning process. This research, therefore, explored three aspects of students' opinions on students' attitude and behaviour to draw from these indicators to develop their teaching-learning process. Research samples were 351 TNI students in the second semester of 2016 academic year, derived through simple random sampling technique. The instruments used for gathering the data were the rating-scale and open-ended questionnaire. The statistics used for analyzing the data were frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, t-test, F-test, and content analysis. It is concluded statistically from this study that students' perception of their attitude and behaviour play a significant role in determining their learning outcomes in humanities and social sciences course, while the lecturers are of the opinion that learning environment is a factor which contributes significantly to the students' achievement in this course. The current study suggested that the instructors should create an attractive and enjoyable environment to get the students to dynamically involve in the classroom activities and learn the humanities and social sciences enthusiastically and efficiently. © 2018 IEEE.",Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; Industrial research; Learning systems; Social sciences computing; Students; Attitude and Behaviour in Learning; Classroom activity; Humanities and social science; Learning environments; Open-ended questionnaire; Simple random sampling; Standard deviation; Teaching-learning process; Teaching,Social Sciences

We have analysed especially the recent research direction called Computational Social Sciences (CSS) that bridges computer analytical approaches with social science challenges, generating new methodologies of Big Data and AI analytics for social sciences. The results indicate that AI and Big Data practices are not confined to CSS only and are diffused in a wide variety of disciplines under Social Sciences and are made use of in many main research lines as well. Thus, the anticipated overlap between the Social Sciences & AI specialization and CSS has yet to be crystallised. Moreover, the impact of computational social science studies is not permeated to social science citation networks yet.

Social psychology and sociology in particular can help to explain how race constructs key aspects of social experience-for example, the role of race in suspicion of African Americans as potentially criminal and the use of excessive force by law enforcement. At the same time, a collaboration between CRT and social science risks undermining CRT critiques of objectivity and neutrality and potentially limits the theory's ability to combat structural forms of racial inequality. CRT scholars can mitigate these risks by choosing social science methods carefully and by recognizing that social science is only one among several modes of knowledge production.

Background: Previously perceived as 'nice to know' rather than 'need to know', the General Medical Council (GMC) now places behavioural and social sciences on the same need-to-know basis as clinical and basic sciences. Attempts have been made to identify what components of these topics medical students need to know; however, it remains unknown if decisions over programme content differ depending on whether or not educationalists have specialist knowledge of the behavioural and social sciences. Methods: In a survey of medical educationalists within all UK medical schools, respondents were asked to indicate from a comprehensive list of psychological, sociological and anthropological concepts what they considered a minimally competent graduate should understand. Comparisons were made between the concepts identified by specialist behavioural and social science (BSS) educators and those without such training. Results: Despite different disciplinary backgrounds, non-specialist educators largely concurred with BSS specialist educators in the concepts they considered tomorrow's doctors should know about. However, among BSS specialists there remained disagreement on what BSS content was relevant for graduates. Differences reflect specialist knowledge and recognition of the role of theoretical underpinning of BSS and reveal gaps in non-specialists knowledge. Conclusions: Educationalists with formal training in the full range of behavioural and social sciences should be involved in the development of BSS curriculum content at both national and school levels. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.","Attitude of Health Personnel; Behavioral Sciences; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; England; Social Sciences; Students, Medical; Teaching; article; behavior; competence; concept analysis; curriculum; decision making; health personnel attitude; human; medical education; medical specialist; medical student; sociology; teaching; training; United Kingdom",Social Sciences

They are being used for a multiplicity of applications for military, leisure, economic, and academic purposes. Their application in academia, especially as social science research tools, has seen a sharp uptake in the last decade. This has been possible due, largely, to significant developments in computerization and miniaturization, which have culminated in safer, cheaper, lighter, and thus more accessible drones for social scientists. Despite their increasingly widespread use, there has not been an adequate reflection on their use in the spatial social sciences. There is need for a deeper reflection on their application in these fields of study. Should the drone even be considered a tool in the toolbox of the social scientist? In which fields is it most relevant? Should it be taught as a course in the social sciences much in the same way that spatially-oriented software packages have become mainstream in institutions of higher learning? What are the ethical implications of its application in spatial social science? This paper is a brief reflection on these questions. We contend that drones are a neutral tool which can be good and evil. They have actual and potentially wide applicability in academia but can be a tool through which breaches in ethics can be occasioned given their unique abilities to capture data from vantage perspectives. Researchers therefore need to be circumspect in how they deploy this powerful tool which is increasingly becoming mainstream in the social sciences. © 2021 by the authors.

The conservation social sciences can provide unique and important contributions to society's understanding of the relationships between humans and nature and to improving conservation practice and outcomes. There are 4 barriers—ideological, institutional, knowledge, and capacity—to meaningful integration of the social sciences into conservation. We provide practical guidance on overcoming these barriers to mainstream the social sciences in conservation science, practice, and policy. Broadly, we recommend fostering knowledge on the scope and contributions of the social sciences to conservation, including social scientists from the inception of interdisciplinary research projects, incorporating social science research and insights during all stages of conservation planning and implementation, building social science capacity at all scales in conservation organizations and agencies, and promoting engagement with the social sciences in and through global conservation policy-influencing organizations. Conservation social scientists, too, need to be willing to engage with natural science knowledge and to communicate insights and recommendations clearly. We urge the conservation community to move beyond superficial engagement with the conservation social sciences. A more inclusive and integrative conservation science—one that includes the natural and social sciences—will enable more ecologically effective and socially just conservation. Better collaboration among social scientists, natural scientists, practitioners, and policy makers will facilitate a renewed and more robust conservation. Mainstreaming the conservation social sciences will facilitate the uptake of the full range of insights and contributions from these fields into conservation policy and practice. © 2016 The Authors.

While civil engineering is a technical discipline and the strong technical education must continue, two new program outcomes, one each in humanities and social sciences have been included. The inclusion of these two outcomes in the second edition of the Body of Knowledge now makes explicit that the contributions of civil engineers are largely to and for human society. Humanities include subjects such as art, philosophy and literature while social sciences include subjects such as political science, economics, sociology and psychology. But how is education in social sciences and humanities currently incorporated into a student's undergraduate education? This paper compares and analyzes the approach to humanities and social science education taken by several different universities in their civil engineering programs. The most common approach can be termed cafeteria style, where students pick and choose courses that meet program criteria for ""approved"" social science and humanities electives. Also common is the requirement for some depth in one area as well as breadth through studies in several areas. This study, while limited in scope, confirms what perhaps was already known through anecdotal information available to those interested in civil engineering education. That is, an analysis of the programs examined for this paper finds that civil engineering curricula are rather uniform in their course requirements in the humanities and social sciences. Further the study affirms that current curricular requirements are consistent with the older ABET criteria (prior to EC 2000) that included a requirement for a minimum of one-half year of humanities and social science courses and a requirement for both ""breadth and depth."" © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.",Behavioral research; Curricula; Education; Engineers; Professional aspects; Social sciences; Students; Anecdotal information; Civil engineering curricula; Civil engineering programs; Course requirements; Engineering profession; Humanities and social science; Technical educations; Undergraduate education; Engineering education,Social Sciences

It is committed to supplying data thinking, resources, and analytics to study human social behavior and social operation laws to accurately grasp and judge the developing path of the discipline, which is of great significance to promote the innovation and development of social sciences. This study is to conduct a systematic quantitative analysis from a bibliometric perspective, aiming to provide a reference for scholars to explore the paths and changing rules in the field. We use the relevant literature in Web of Science as the dataset. After eliminating journal calls and irrelevant literature, R language and SciMAT tools are used to visualize and analyze the number of articles, keyword clustering, keyword cooccurrence network, and theme evolution, so as to summarize and sort out the paths of computational social science research. The study found that the annual volume of publications has been gradually increasing and will probably remain active in the next few years with high productivity. Subject themes in different periods are diversified, and the evolutionary relationship is found complex as well. Besides, as a cross discipline, scientific knowledge from different fields cross collides and couples with each other in the big data environment, changing the traditional concept of computational social science and forming a new development path. Recently, the emergence of ""big data+""has promoted the rise of new subject areas, making the development of new disciplines a reality.  © 2022 Yuxi Liu et al.",Economic and social effects; Social behavior; Bibliometric; Computational social science; Keyword-clustering; Long-term development; Metric analysis; Operation law; R languages; Social behaviour; Social science data; Web of Science; Big data,Social Sciences

Faced with the failure of the polls, the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) intervened quickly to prevent social science’s adversaries from using this event to degrade further its status. After all, many social scientists considered the sample survey as the paramount tool of social research, and sampling as one of social science’s greatest innovation. Concurrently, there was an ongoing conflict among polling practitioners themselves—between advocates of probability sampling and users of quotas, like the pollsters. The SSRC committee appointed to evaluate the polling debacle managed to keep this contentious issue of sampling from becoming the centre of attention. Given the inauspicious environment in which this event happened, the SSRC did not wish to advertise the fact that the house of social science was in turmoil. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","History, 20th Century; Politics; Research; Social Sciences; United States; Surveys; National Science Foundations; Policy debates; Presidential election; Probability sampling; Social research; Social science research; Social scientists; Status recognition; history; politics; research; sociology; United States; Behavioral research",Social Sciences

However, the question arises: to what extent do natural sciences rely on social science research in their studies? Examining life science publications from seven PLoS journals, this paper attempts to characterize the volume and trajectory of citations from life sciences to social sciences. We explore three core questions: To what extent do life sciences cite social sciences? What actors in the life sciences are citing social sciences? Which actors in the social sciences are being cited? Our analysis estimates social sciences influence 15%–19% of life science publications, contributing to 1.1%–1.5% of references in 2018. Social science citers are found across peripheral and central topics of life science disciplines. Cited social science publications exhibit various levels of interdisciplinarity and achieve the greatest citation impact among peers. Citations to social sciences are prevalent in both theoretically and methodologically oriented sections. We show empirically the increasing impact of social sciences on the development of the life sciences. © 2024 Association for Information Science and Technology.",Economic and social effects; Publishing; Citation impact; Interaction mechanisms; Interdisciplinarity; Life-sciences; Natural systems; Science disciplines; Social perspective; Social science research; Social systems; article; human; sociology; Behavioral research,Social Sciences

In social sciences a movement can be found related to the successes and developments of natural sciences-The ideal of social sciences was to imitate the natural scienceś mathematical methods. But since Durkheim, Dilthey, Weber, Gadamer and others, the social sciences have been based on a fundament different from natural sciences and even superior to them.

The increasing human-like capabilities of AI are also attracting attention in social science research, leading to various studies exploring the combination of these two fields. In this survey, we systematically categorize previous explorations in the combination of AI and social science into two directions that share common technical approaches but differ in their research objectives. The first direction is focused on AI for social science, where AI is utilized as a powerful tool to enhance various stages of social science research. While the second direction is the social science of AI, which examines AI agents as social entities with their human-like cognitive and linguistic capabilities. By conducting a thorough review, particularly on the substantial progress facilitated by recent advancements in large language models, this paper introduces a fresh perspective to reassess the relationship between AI and social science, provides a cohesive framework that allows researchers to understand the distinctions and connections between AI for social science and social science of AI, and also summarizes state-of-art experiment simulation platforms to facilitate research in these two directions.

But China is still not yet a major player in the arena of social sciences, as is evidenced by the number of Chinese journals indexed in SSCI and the lack of Olympic players. Team research features China's international publishing in social science, but the research outputs are highly unbalanced at regional and institutional levels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Behavioral research; Social sciences; Social sciences computing; Bibliometric analysis; China; Global growth; Research evaluation; Research outputs; Science and technology policy; Social science citation indices; Social science research; Economic and social effects,Social Sciences

With roots in the biophysical sciences, social sciences, and peasant movements, agroecology is a transdisciplinary field bringing together different ways of knowing. Agroecological research has two main foci: a biophysical focus which operationalizes agroecology as the ecological study of agricultural production systems, and a socio-ecological focus that emphasizes agriculture as a coupled socio-ecological system, the importance of food systems and food security at the household and community level, and a normative dimension, focusing on social (in)justice and power inequalities. OBJECTIVE: We examine the relationship between agroecology and the social sciences, asking specifically: 1) How are the engagements between agroecology and the social sciences changing over time, and how does this relationship compare to publishing trends in the biophysical and social sciences generally? 2) What is the engagement of agroecology over time with specific social science disciplines and fields — anthropology, economics, education, feminist studies, geography, political ecology/economy, sociology — and the recent social science topics of food justice and food sovereignty? 3) How do the topics and geographical focus of agroecology engaged with social science (AESS) differ from those of agroecology not engaged with social science (ANESS)? And, 4) in which journals are AESS and ANESS published? METHODS: We quantitatively examine 7399 unique publications — gathered from five publication databases into our Agroecology Discipline Corpus 1960–2019 — to answer these questions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses show 1) the proportion of AESS is increasing over time, and that agroecology publications are growing at about double the rate of scientific literature overall; 2) increased engagement between agroecology and almost all social science disciplines and fields examined; 3) substantial topical differences between ANESS and AESS exist, reflecting ontological foci, as well as strong geographical differences in the proportion of AESS and ANESS; and 4) publication venues are not widely shared between AESS and ANESS, and a wide array of additional journals have become important venues for agroecological research from 2007 to 2019. We conclude by posing further questions about agroecology and the social sciences to be asked of the corpus we have assembled and classified. SIGNIFICANCE: This review shows that agroecology's engagement with the social sciences has expanded greatly in recent decades, suggesting its further development as a transdisciplinary science and signaling its increasing relevance for large-scale agrifood systems change. © 2024 The Authors",agroecology; interdisciplinary approach; literature review; publishing; research work,Social Sciences

Scholars in the region still sheepishly cling to the aprons of past generations of social scientists who had based their scholarship on an outdated materialist, evolutionist worldview. Most Arab social scientist are hardly aware of the revolutionary accounts given by historians and philosophers of science which have shown that the current version of the ""scientific method"" was in fact shaped by specific historical events which negate claims of universality. Its insistence on the ""belief"" that sense experiences are the only legitimate source of knowledge, to the complete exclusion of ""revelation"" was found to be the bitter harvest of the violent clash between the church and renaissance scientists in Europe. The resulting warped view of reality and of science led to the current ""crisis"" in the social sciences. However, the epochal new discoveries in physics, and neurological sciences had decades ago, started the movement towards the ""New Philosophy of Science"" and ""New Paradigm Research"" which are holistic and more balanced - allowing for the inclusion of mental and spiritual factors as causal factors for understanding human behavior. This paper traces these new developments in some detail. These developments seem to lead towards a scientific revolution in the social sciences commensurate with Sorokin's ""Integralist View of Truth and Reality"" based on truths of revelation, reason, and the senses. The Issue is further developed to show that the ""Islamization of the social sciences"" seems to be the antidote to the current malaise of the social sciences, providing the best hope for their furture effectiveness.",Arab world,Social Sciences

Despite the broad and increasing social effects of these events, the empirical basis of disaster research is often weak, partially due to the natural paucity of observed data. At the same time, some of the early research regarding social responses to disasters have become outdated as social, cultural, and political norms have changed. The digital revolution, the open data trend, and the advancements in data science provide new opportunities for social science disaster research. We introduce the term computational social science of disasters (CSSD), which can be formally defined as the systematic study of the social behavioral dynamics of disasters utilizing computational methods. In this paper, we discuss and showcase the opportunities and the challenges in this new approach to disaster research. Following a brief review of the fields that relate to CSSD, namely traditional social sciences of disasters, computational social science, and crisis informatics, we examine how advances in Internet technologies offer a new lens through which to study disasters. By identifying gaps in the literature, we show how this new field could address ways to advance our understanding of the social and behavioral aspects of disasters in a digitally connected world. In doing so, our goal is to bridge the gap between data science and the social sciences of disasters in rapidly changing environments. © 2019 by the authors.",Behavioral research; Big data; Crowdsourcing; Data Science; Disasters; Open Data; Social sciences computing; Computational social science; Crisis informatics; Geographical information; Social media; Web 2.0; Economic and social effects,Social Sciences

They appear as explanatory elements in structural theories, or they are of interest as the outcome of an intervention, for example a support or a preventive programme, a therapy, or a marketing activity. These constructs are typically considered to imply a quantitative latent variable that exists independently of measurement. As a matter of routine, measures of latent variables in the social sciences are treated in the same way as natural scientists handle and utilize their measures. However, in terms of what the concept of measurement is actually about, the social sciences have veered away from the rigorous concept adhered to in the natural sciences. An arbitrary definition of measurement and a multitude of procedures which are deemed appropriate for quantification have resulted in a speculative approach to measurement. Based on a return to the standard definition of measurement and a new conceptualisation of content and construct validity, the social sciences could advance their quantitative research substantially.

This interaction is represented by two approaches: autonomous social science and prophetic social science. The article argues that both approaches have their distinct inclinations in perceiving and formulating theoretical foundations. These inclinations are shaped by their unique qualities, alternative values, intellectual stances, and thinking styles. Moreover, during the process of development, they are influenced by various factors that give them their distinct characteristics, such as autonomy, a problem-based approach, and a strong commitment to rethinking society and driving change and transformation. The social concept of Islam Nusantara represents this development. It is a collection of arguments and practices of Islam adopted by Muslims in Nusantara, which have shaped patterns of social relations and cohesiveness through communicative actions throughout a specific historical epoch in the region. The article also highlights two essential factors that significantly shape these approaches: the dominant schools of thought in social science and the peculiar Malay-Indonesian traditions. While Western social sciences have played a central role in understanding certain concepts, Malay-Indonesian traditions have contributed significantly to shaping the paradigm of local scholars. © 2022.

Objectives: This study aims to understand the current academic literature on AMR within the social science field by investigating international contributions, emerging topics, influential articles, and prominent outlets, to identify research gaps and future directions. Methods: Bibliometric data of 787 peer-reviewed journal articles published in the period of 2010 to 2019 were extracted from the Social Science Citation Index in the Web of Science database. Bibliographic networks of the extracted articles were examined. Results: Social science research on AMR has grown rapidly in the past 5 years. While western developed countries contributed the most to the field in the past decade, research within developing regions such as Asia and Africa have increased in the last 2 years. Social sciences have been contributing to AMR research in several different domains from surveillance and risk assessment of AMR, to promotions of appropriate use of antimicrobials in primary care and clinical settings. Though the idea of one health has been incorporated into research on AMR within the medical and microbial science fields, it has not been well recognized by social sciences. Conclusion: Social science research on AMR is a new, while rapidly developing, research area that requires continued and intense global efforts from an interdisciplinary and one health approach. Research on social issues surrounding AMR transmissions between human, animal, and environments should be emphasized in the future. © 2020, The Author(s).","Anti-Infective Agents; Bibliometrics; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Humans; Research; Risk Assessment; Social Sciences; World Health Organization; antiinfective agent; Africa; antibiotic resistance; Asia; bibliometrics; developed country; human; human experiment; primary medical care; review; risk assessment; sociology; systematic review; Web of Science; bibliometrics; research; World Health Organization",Social Sciences

One way in which the digital humanities and social sciences add value, particularly in an increasingly digitised society, is by engaging different communities through digital services and products. Alongside this observation, the field of user experience (UX) has also become popular in industrial settings. UX specifically concerns designing and developing digital products and solutions, and, while it is popular in business and other academic domains, there is disquiet in the digital humanities/social sciences towards UX and a general lack of engagement. This paper shares the reflections and insights of a digital humanities/social science practitioner working on a UX project to build a prototype demonstrator for disaster risk reduction. Insights come from formal developmental and participatory evaluation activities, as well as qualitative self-reflection. The paper identifies lessons learnt, noting challenges experienced—including feelings of uncertainty and platform dependency—and reflects on the hesitancy practitioners may have and potential barriers in participation between UX and the digital humanities/social science. It concludes that digital humanities/social science practitioners have few skill barriers and offer a valued perspective, but unclear opportunities for critical engagement may present a barrier. © 2023 by the author.",,Social Sciences

Yet many sociologists regard value-free social science as undesirable or impossible and readily make value judgments in the name of sociology. Often they display confusion about such matters as the meaning of value-free social science, value judgments internal and external to social science, value judgments as a subject of social science, the relevance of objectivity for value-free social science, and the difference between the human significance of social science and value-free social science. But why so many sociologists are so value-involved - and generally so unscientific - is sociologically understandable: The closest and most distant subjects attract the least scientific ideas. And during the past century sociologists have become increasingly close to their human subject. The debate about value-free social science is also part of an epistemological counterrevolution of humanists (including many sociologists) against the more scientific social scientists who invaded and threatened to expropriate the human subject during the past century. © London School of Economics and Political Science 2013.",Humans; Judgment; Social Sciences; Social Values; decision making; ethics; human; social psychology; sociology; standards,Social Sciences

The field's research practices are increasingly expected to conform to prescribed relationships with the people studied. Expectations about community centrality influence scholarly activities. These expectations can pressure social scientists to adhere to models of community involvement that are immediate and that include community-based co-investigators, advisory boards, and liaisons. In this context, disregarding community centrality can be interpreted as failure. This paper considers evolving norms about the centrality of community in social science. It problematises community inclusion and discusses concerns about the impact of community centrality on incremental theory development, academic integrity, freedom of speech, and the value of liberal versus communitarian knowledge. Through the application of a constructivist approach, this paper argues that social science in which community is omitted or on the periphery is not failed science, because not all social science requires a community base to make a genuine and valuable contribution. The utility of community centrality is not necessarily universal across all social science pursuits. The practices of knowing within social science disciplines may be difficult to transfer to a community. These practices of knowing require degrees of specialisation and interest that not all communities may want or have. © 2015 © 2015 The Author(s).

The complexity of research topics in social science makes it the amalgamation of multiple disciplines, such as economics, political science, and sociology, etc. For centuries, scientists have conducted many studies to understand the mechanisms of the society. However, due to the limitations of traditional research methods, there exist many critical social issues to be explored. To solve those issues, computational social science emerges due to the rapid advancements of computation technologies and the profound studies on social science. With the aids of the advanced research techniques, various kinds of data from diverse areas can be acquired nowadays, and they can help us look into social problems with a new eye. As a result, utilizing various data to reveal issues derived from computational social science area has attracted more and more attentions. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we present a survey on data-driven computational social science for the first time which primarily focuses on reviewing application domains involving human dynamics. The state-of-the-art research on human dynamics is reviewed from three aspects: individuals, relationships, and collectives. Specifically, the research methodologies used to address research challenges in aforementioned application domains are summarized. In addition, some important open challenges with respect to both emerging research topics and research methods are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Behavioral research; Dynamics; Metals; Social sciences computing; Surveys; Applications domains; Collective; Computational social science; Data driven; Human dynamics; Individual; Machine-learning; Relationship; Research method; Research topics; Machine learning,Social Sciences

To analyze the debate on the construction of the object of the social sciences and its implications in the training of teachers. Discussion. At first, a conceptualization of the social sciences is proposed by defending the juxtaposed ontology of its object; likewise, epistemological and methodological considerations are debated in terms of totality. Then, it is reflected on the place of the subject who practices the social sciences and its consequences in the production of knowledge. Finally, considerations are raised on the training of teachers in social sciences. Conclusions. The curricular design to train teachers in social sciences must go through the construction of spaces that lead to two actions: First, to problematize aspects of reality without being reduced to compartmentalization of the departments; and second, to generate an epistemological awareness that leads them to account for their order of intellection or policies of interpretation in the production of knowledge. © 2022 Universidad Nacional.

The minor targets students in majors such as Psychology and Economics, which have a more diverse student population than that of Computer Science or Engineering. The minor, designed with industry input, includes a four-course sequence that focuses on Python and R and includes topics such as data structures, algorithms, data cleaning and management, and data analysis. Our cohort-based program was built specifically for social science students using social science content, helping to foster a sense of community and belongingness among students.

Commonly used social science methods therefore already cover one type of CS that is defined by including volunteers mainly in data collection: contributory CS.

Over the last 5 years, social science approaches in aviation biofuels research, particularly site-selection, have made several advances. Where early site-selection models either entirely excluded social science concepts or included only a few measurements using poor proxies, current models more accurately, and more comprehensively capture key social science concepts to better examine and predict project implementation success and long-term sustainability. Despite several studies published within the last 20 years noting the need for more empirical studies of social sustainability and improvement in incorporation of social criteria, progress has remained rather stagnant in several areas. To help move the field forward, we conduct a review of the current state of social science research in aviation biofuels with a focus on sustainability, site-selection, and public acceptance research, identifying key approaches, important developments, and research gaps and weaknesses of current approaches. While several review studies already exist, they tend to focus on a single area of biofuels such as public acceptance. By broadening our review to several areas, we are able to identify several common limitations across these areas that contribute to the continued underutilization of social science approaches in aviation biofuels. This includes the preference for practical and reliable indicators for social criteria that prioritize quantitative methods over other approaches. Based on these limitations, we make several recommendations to improve social science research in aviation biofuels, including ensuring that social scientists are key members of the research team, the adoption of a mixed-methods research designs that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches that better measure some criteria and local-level impacts, and adequate resources for social science research throughout biofuel development projects as these methods are often more time-consuming and costly to implement. We argue that implementing these recommendations in future aviation biofuel development projects will improve social science approaches utilized in aviation biofuels research and address a long-acknowledged gap in the field.

It is a key component of how environmental agencies work to protect public health and the environment. There are many publications on technical protocols for cleanup and waste disposal. Additionally, there has been much social science work on the social problems of environmental contamination. However, social science research on cleanup itself has been much more scattered across disciplines and incidents. To date, there has not been a comprehensive review of the social factors that affect cleanup processes and outcomes. Such social factors may include cultural worldviews that shape stakeholder perspectives on 'how clean is clean' and social relationships among stakeholders. This article fills this gap by providing an interdisciplinary literature review of the social science of environmental cleanup. Three principal themes emerged from the 97 articles that met selection criteria: effects on cleanup worker health, public engagement and decision-making, and societal benefits of cleaned-up sites. The review points to areas where further research is needed. For example, there is a lack of mixed methods and interdisciplinary engagement within the literature. Additionally, few articles compare cleanup situations. There is also a need for further investigation into specific social science topics such as labor practices, gender, race, and power relationships. To address these gaps, we argue for the development of a comprehensive framework or model as well as the exploration of broader questions complicating cleanups. Overall, this area of research has significant potential to benefit environmental cleanup policy and practice worldwide, while advancing social theory about people and the environment. © 2018 The Author(s).

The Geographical Information Science (GIS), with powerful functions of spatial data management, spatial analysis and geo-visualization, has been widely used in humanities and social sciences in the era of big data, resulting in an emerging inter-disciplinary field that is Spatial Integrated Humanities and Social Sciences (SIHSS). SIHSS can provide new comprehensive solutions to practical problems that are difficult to solve in a single discipline. Since the first forum on spatially integrated humanities and social sciences was held at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2009, this new inter-discipline has developed vigorously and achieved significant progress. We comprehensively summarized the progress of this new field on the tenth forum, held at Wuhan University in 2019. GIS has been fully integrated with humanities and social sciences, including philosophy, history, literature, art, sociology, economics, politics, and management science. On the one hand, scholars and experts in the field of GIS are actively expanding their research fields to provide spatial and visualization technologies for scholars in fields of humanities and social sciences. On the other hand, scholars in fields of humanities and social sciences are actively learning GIS technologies and bringing spatial thinking into their research. Meanwhile, some open platforms, codes, and tools customized for scholars in fields of humanities and social sciences are constantly emerging. In this paper, based on a comprehensive summary of the recent progress of SIHSS, we first investigated the thought and framework of the research on SIHSS, and then introduced the progress in each detailed direction of SIHSS, including history integrated GIS, literature integrated GIS, linguistics integrated GIS, GIS and philosophy, human dynamics, human geography, politics GIS and, GIS and management science, spatial econometrics, geo-computation for social science, spatial social networks and spatial interaction networks, geography of crime, geography of public health, etc. We also summarized methodologies for the research on SIHSS, including spatial thinking, cognitive psychology and spatial cognition, spatial visualization and virtual geographic analysis, and GIS platform development, etc. Finally, we proposed research directions of SIHSS in the future, including further improving the research framework and developing new methods of SIHSS, combining perspectives of map, data, spatial analysis and visualization, developing online platforms and promoting open data and open source tools, further expanding the application of GIS in humanities and social sciences, and strengthening education and training on SIHSS. We conclude that GIS is about to play an increasingly important role in humanities and social sciences and SHISS will also achieve greater advancement and achievement. © 2020, Science Press.

Over 150 years after their founding period, there is significant fragmentation and unevenness in this quest to understand the human condition. Distinct hierarchies and exclusionary structures emerged between the ""West"" and regions like Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, China and India and many parts of Asia. Some countries, even entire regions, are terra incognita from a Western vantage point and relegated to ""area studies."" At the same time, distinct social science traditions have formed in countries and regions outside the West, with a new interest in developing approaches that rely less on Western foundations and conventional academic practices. The questions become: Are the social sciences drifting further apart, or is there a possibility of greater dialogue, even cohesiveness, to advance our knowledge and understanding globally rather than only in some regions or countries? And if so, why, how, and for what? What are the main foci in research and teaching? What is the degree of institutionalization, and how could the global, regional, and national potentials of the social sciences be better realized? To approach these questions, Global Perspectives launches systematic assessments of the state and the potential of the social sciences in different parts of the world. They address five key issue clusters: Western hegemony and fragmentation; basic conceptual and epistemological considerations; ideologies and normative foundations; academic freedom; and professionalization and commercialization. Given the significant scale and complex scope of the social sciences with their many specific subfields, methodologies, and curricula as well as varying degrees of professional institutionalization and different political backgrounds, the special collections present reflective essays on the state and the potential of the social sciences rather than comprehensive empirical stock-taking. © 2023 The Author(s).",,Social Sciences

However to date, this integration remains inadequate, fragmented and under-funded, with limited reach and small initial investments. Based on data collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, in this paper we analysed the variety of knowledge, infrastructure and funding gaps that hinder the full integration of the social sciences in epidemics and present a strategic framework for addressing them. Methods: Senior social scientists with expertise in public health emergencies facilitated expert deliberations, and conducted 75 key informant interviews, a consultation with 20 expert social scientists from Africa, Asia and Europe, 2 focus groups and a literature review of 128 identified high-priority peer reviewed articles. We also analysed 56 interviews from the Ebola 100 project, collected just after the West African Ebola epidemic. Analysis was conducted on gaps and recommendations. These were inductively classified according to various themes during two group prioritization exercises. The project was conducted between February and May 2019. Findings from the report were used to inform strategic prioritization of global investments in social science capacities for health emergencies. Findings: Our analysis consolidated 12 knowledge and infrastructure gaps and 38 recommendations from an initial list of 600 gaps and 220 recommendations. In developing our framework, we clustered these into three areas: 1) Recommendations to improve core social science response capacities, including investments in: human resources within response agencies; the creation of social science data analysis capacities at field and global level; mechanisms for operationalizing knowledge; and a set of rapid deployment infrastructures; 2) Recommendations to strengthen applied and basic social sciences, including the need to: better define the social science agenda and core competencies; support innovative interdisciplinary science; make concerted investments in developing field ready tools and building the evidence-base; and develop codes of conduct; and 3) Recommendations for a supportive social science ecosystem, including: the essential foundational investments in institutional development; training and capacity building; awareness-raising activities with allied disciplines; and lastly, support for a community of practice. Interpretation: Comprehensively integrating social science into the epidemic preparedness and response architecture demands multifaceted investments on par with allied disciplines, such as epidemiology and virology. Building core capacities and competencies should occur at multiple levels, grounded in country-led capacity building. Social science should not be a parallel system, nor should it be “siloed” into risk communication and community engagement. Rather, it should be integrated across existing systems and networks, and deploy interdisciplinary knowledge “transversally” across all preparedness and response sectors and pillars. Future work should update this framework to account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the institutional landscape. © 2020, The Author(s).",Capacity Building; Communicable Disease Control; Epidemics; Global Health; Humans; Qualitative Research; Social Sciences; anthropology; COVID-19; epidemic; governance approach; infectious disease; integrated approach; investment; public health; strategic approach; viral disease; anthropology; Article; awareness; competence; coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; emergency health service; emergency response time; epidemic; global health; health care policy; health care quality; human; integration; interdisciplinary research; pandemic; politics; priority journal; social aspect; sociology; capacity building; communicable disease control; epidemic; organization and management; qualitative research; sociology,Social Sciences

One key concept within complexity science is that of self-organization. Self-organization is used to refer to the emergence of stable patterns through autonomous and self-reinforcing dynamics at the micro-level. In spite of its potential relevance for the study of social dynamics, the articulation and use of the concept of self-organization has been kept within the boundaries of complexity science and links to and from mainstream social science are scarce. These links can be difficult to establish, even for researchers working in social complexity with a background in social science, because of the theoretical and conceptual diversity and fragmentation in traditional social science. This article is meant to serve as a first step in the process of overcoming this lack of cross-fertilization between complexity and mainstream social science. A systematic review of the concept of self-organization and a critical discussion of similar notions in mainstream social science is presented, in an effort to help practitioners within subareas of complexity science to identify literature from traditional social science that could potentially inform their research. © 2016, The Author(s).",Behavioral research; Phase equilibria; Complexity; Complexity science; Critical discussions; Cross fertilization; Order; Self organizations; Social contract; Systematic Review; Social sciences,Social Sciences

Individuals within marine social science are not solely “pure” social scientists, but rather are a diverse and interdisciplinary community, including many who have moved from the natural sciences to pursue a career in marine social science. This is particularly the case for early career researchers, with many moving from natural to social science earlier in their academic careers than their predecessors, and thus developing stronger interdisciplinary skills than previous generations of social scientists. In this perspective, we draw on our experiences, highlighting our main motivations for moving from natural to social science, the barriers we have faced and our top tips for early career researchers faced with similar opportunities and challenges.

In that regard, Big Data is gaining meaning into social science from quantitative datasets side, which differs from traditional social science where collecting data has always been hard, time consuming, and resource intensive. Hence, the emergent field of computational social science is broadening researchers' perspectives. However, it also requires a multidisciplinary approach involving several and different knowledge areas. This paper outlines an architectural framework and methodology to collect Big Data from an electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) website containing user-generated content. Although the paper is written from the social science perspective, it must be also considered together with other complementary disciplines such as data accessing and computing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Their material knowledge of technology and science is the result of content they learned in highschool themselves. After having graduated, they chose social-sciences or humanities as their subjects. There is little or no overlap between science and engineering subjects and social-science and humanities subjects in teacher training programs. That is not institutionally aimed for, but rather the consequence of the students choices. The consequence for science- and technology awareness among the students is problematic, to say the least. While their knowledge of science and technology -being the product of high-school education - is often not up to date and also lacking in current developments, their moral and ethical judgement about the implications of scientific research and use of technology is strong. The preliminary study also showed, that the students are interested in new technological and scientific developments, they just lack the ability to include this into their world-view, which is very strongly influenced by their choice of subjects in the humanities and social-sciences. Teaching these students has convinced the authors, that their lack of technology and science knowledge combined with their inherent tendency to judge science and technology from the point of view of their respective field impairs their ability to take an adequate part in science and technology discourse. Their awareness and thus their competence to rationally engage with science and technology is lacking. That is in part due to the depiction of science and technology in humanities and social-science courses, on the other hand due to a lack in current science and technology education as part of a humanities and social -sciences program. The result becomes even more alarming if we assume that the future teachers will continue to relay their heavily biased opinions on science and technology in general, as well as their deficient knowledge of specific technologies to their future students, thus generating a vicious cycle of inadequate technology and science awareness. As the authors study has shown, these students are really interested in science and technology, they just lack key competencies to make an analytical connection between their field of choice (humanities and social-sciences) and technology and science, without resorting to moral and ethical judgement. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Following the EBM, social sciences ranging from education to public governance and policymaking entered a new stage of knowledge production and dissemination. Each evidence-based social science field produces its own evidence and evidence synthesis laying the foundation for efficient social practices. Pilot searches failed to bring complex and complete evidence-based methodology for social sciences. Purpose: This scoping review aims to identify the scope of the evidence-based social sciences and practices as an emerging field. Method: The review adhered to the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews, and the PPC framework. The eligibility criteria include problem (population), concept, context, language, time period, types of sources, geographical location, databases, areas of research. The searches to identify relevant publications entail searches in the Scopus database. The studies were identified and selected by screening titles, abstracts and full texts, totalling 35 documents. Results: The results cover search and selection outcomes; a bibliometric analysis, the breakdown of the publications among the four thematic clusters; the findings relating to evidence-based medicine and practice methodology applicable to social sciences; the analysis of the research area of evidence-based social sciences and practices; the social science practices by sectors. Much of the EBM methodology was directly borrowed by social sciences. Though, the major controversy was found in the hierarchy and levels of evidence as social sciences are subject to human choices. Randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews were analysed in the context of social sciences. The most elaborated and fast developing evidence-based areas in social sciences contained evidence-based education and evidence-based policymaking, with systems of governmental agencies and institutions introducing these evidence-based practices. Сonclusion. The review attained the objective and gave answers to the research questions. Only few studies were published to comprehensively address the emerging field of evidence-based social sciences and practices. Fragmentated sub-fields are covered unevenly, with many mythological divergences and disputed issues, including the quality of evidence, their weight and hierarchy, types of research. © 2024 National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

From the perspective of development, the fields of humanities and social sciences have actually experienced a process of continuous understanding and construction of data resources. The view of data resources is changing from traditional limited sample data and “small data” to big data and smart data. At present, the phenomenons of “protection”, “seclusion”, “isolation”, “homogeny” and “show” still exist in the data resources development and utilization in humanities and social sciences. To this end, the authors think that the data resources development and utilization in humanities and social sciences need to meet the national strategic needs and assume the functional positioning of memory, production, traceability, prediction and dissemination under the perspective of humanities and social sciences in the new era. For better guidance, this paper constructs the development and utilization path framework of humanities and social sciences data resources from the theoretical perspective, which takes the subject layer, the content layer and the guarantee layer as the core. The subject layer emphasizes the cooperation among the top planning subjects, database building subjects and data users The content layer highlights the combination path of logic dimension, resource dimension, method dimension and verification dimension The guarantee layer involves policies and regulations, capital projects, human resources, cultural atmosphere and other safeguard measures. Facing the future, the data resources development and utilization in humanities and social sciences need to actively build the governmentality of humanities and social sciences data resources, and change the concept from the “resource-based theory” to the “governance capabilities theory”. Concrete actions can be promoted from the data infrastructure system construction, multi-disciplinary data resources co growth mechanism construction, data resources property rights and security and effective protection, data resource based service chain construction and other aspects. The exploration and discovery of this paper is expected to provide better guidance for the construction, management and service of data resources in humanities and social sciences, and improve the data discourse construction in humanities and social sciences. 1 fig. 15 refs. © 2024, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

The traditional approach to this is very stringent by trying to find causal explanations and models. However, this approach has been recently criticized for preventing progress due to neglecting prediction abilities of models that support more problem-oriented approaches. The latter models would be enabled by the surge of big Web-data currently available. Interestingly, this problem cannot be overcome with methods from computational social science (CSS) alone because this field is dominated by simulation-based approaches and descriptive models. In this article, we address this issue and argue that the combination of big social data with social networks is needed for creating prediction models. We will argue that this alliance has the potential for gradually establishing a causal social theory. In order to emphasize the importance of integrating big social data with social networks, we call this approach data-driven computational social network science (DD-CSNS). © Copyright © 2021 Emmert-Streib and Dehmer.",,Social Sciences

Therefore, conservation actions are needed everywhere on Earth, including in the biodiversity rich landscapes and seascapes where people live and work that cover much of the planet. Integrative landscape and seascape approaches to conservation fill this niche. Making evidence-informed conservation decisions within these populated and working landscapes and seascapes requires an in-depth and nuanced understanding of the human dimensions through application of the conservation social sciences. Yet, there has been no comprehensive exploration of potential conservation social science contributions to working landscape and seascape initiatives. We use the Smithsonian Working Land and Seascapes initiative – an established program with a network of 14 sites around the world – as a case study to examine what human dimensions topics are key to improving our understanding and how this knowledge can inform conservation in working landscapes and seascapes. This exploratory study identifies 38 topics and linked questions related to how insights from place-based and problem-focused social science might inform the planning, doing, and learning phases of conservation decision-making and adaptive management. Results also show how conservation social science might yield synthetic and theoretical insights that are more broadly applicable. We contend that incorporating insights regarding the human dimensions into integrated conservation initiatives across working landscapes and seascapes will produce more effective, equitable, appropriate and robust conservation actions. Thus, we encourage governments and organizations working on conservation initiatives in working landscapes and seascapes to increase engagement with and funding of conservation social science.

Previous HIV vaccine research has considered behavioral and social issues, but often treated them as independent of clinical research processes. Systematic attention to the intersection of behavioral and social issues within a defined clinical research framework is needed to address gaps, such as those related to participation in trials, completion of trials, and the overall research experience. Rigorous attention to these issues at project inception can inform trial design and conduct by matching research approaches to the context in which trials are to be conducted. Conducting behavioral and social sciences research concurrent with vaccine clinical research is important because it can help identify potential barriers to trial implementation, as well as ultimate acceptance and dissemination of trial results. We therefore propose a conceptual framework for behavioral and social science in HIV vaccine clinical research and use examples from the behavioral and social science literature to demonstrate how the model can facilitate identification of significant areas meriting additional exploration. Standardized use of the conceptual framework could improve HIV vaccine clinical research efficiency and relevance. © 2011.",AIDS Vaccines; Behavior; Biomedical Research; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Patient Compliance; Patient Participation; Social Sciences; antiretrovirus agent; Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine; microbicide; article; behavioral science; clinical research; community; conceptual framework; condom; epidemic; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; priority journal; social behavior; sociology,Social Sciences

The research agenda was distilled as faithfully as possible from the efforts of a host of scientists. These included a series of white papers; a workshop in Pomona, Calif., in February 2005; several sessions at the 2004 and 2005 Natural Hazards workshops held in Boulder, Colo.; and additional input from the broader social science research community unable to attend these events. Expected results from this effort are (1) a focused applied research agenda designed to generate short-term immediate benefits; (2) a broader, more basic research agenda addressing fundamental theoretical and exploratory research designed to generate long-term improvements; (3) methods to enable the social science research community to gather and further develop research priorities and future agendas; and (4) a concept for a long-term, multidisciplinary, institutional approach to undertaking identified research priorities. This paper is presented as a call to action for the appropriate agencies and organizations to support social science research on the high-priority issues in the hurricane forecast and warning system to meet societal goals of protecting lives and property in the face of the ever-present threat of hurricanes. © 2007 ASCE.",Citrus macrophylla; Alarm systems; Hurricanes; Research and development management; Weather forecasting; Hurricane forecast; Social science research; hurricane; research; warning system; weather forecasting; Social sciences,Social Sciences

The premise is that both social scientists and health care professionals share complementary intellectual interests in fostering empirical research on health and illness. Barriers built into the orientation and reward structure of both professions impede collaborative efforts. In our view, however, the advantages of working on these problems outweigh the disadvantages. Toward this end, we suggest several substantive and methodological directions to be encouraged and then discuss prospects for collaboration from the perspectives of social science, medicine and the wider society. We see opportunity for comparative work, synthesis and the systematic nesting of findings into a knowledge base that will permit generalizations. Our goal is to improve the fit between social science and health practice by increasing the relevance of social science findings for the delivery of care and the training of health care professionals. In addition, hopefully, our suggestions will advance social research independent of its impact on the health field. © 1987.","Chronic Disease; Epidemiologic Methods; Human; Interprofessional Relations; Medicine; Research; Social Sciences; Sociology, Medical; chronic disease; epidemiology; human; medicine; public relations; research; review; sociology",Social Sciences

Design/methodology/approach: Classroom teaching is communication. Therefore, it is crucial that an analysis of quality of social science teaching includes a focus on communicative quality. The theoretical basis of the article is therefore threefold. 1) A Bakhtin-inspired communicative approach, 2) sociocultural ethnographic classroom research and 3) social science didactics/social science teaching discourse. Discourse is not only understood as language, but as language in context, which means that it’s not only communication as spoken words, utterances, but also communication as actions (doings) that count as disciplinary work. Findings: It is concluded that communicative quality in social science teaching, and perhaps in teaching in general, can be observed as utterances in the classroom analysed for their coherence between form, content, and goal (intended function), which accordingly are the basic elements of an observation tool developed. When utterances are recurring and thus form patterns, they are called practices. The tool aims to keep focus on form, content, and goal (intended function) of the basic subject discourse, which functions as an underlying structuring of classroom communication. It is also concluded that the normative basis for social science teaching can be operationalized and thus serve as a guidance of interpretations of observations made in the classroom of the form and content of teaching. Research limitations/implications. The tool is designed to focus specifically on social science quality. It is not a suggestion to disregard generic conditions in the teaching, and therefore the use of the tool presupposes that this is done in connection with a generic observational focus. The tool has not been tested on a large scale, and therefore it must be expected that it will have to be further developed during use. © 2022, sowi-online e.V..

The actual integration of social science information, however, remains limited in many policy and decision-making processes within fisheries. Our study provides insights into factors that influence the intention to use social science information among fishery managers and the actual integration of such information into fishery management. Based on interviews with fishery managers in the Great Lakes, we find that the lack of social science expertise in fishery management agencies leads to multiple negative beliefs and attitudes, and subsequently a low intention to use social science information in decision-making processes. At the same time, the paper finds that more expertise in decision-making tools and basing social science on equal footing with natural sciences within fishery management institutions appears critical to advance the actual integration of social science information in fishery management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,Social Sciences

We found an increasing diversification in the publishing sources of Vietnamese social science researchers with growth rates of 9.8% and 14.1% per annum in the number of publishers and journals, respectively. Given that the proportion of Gold OA articles had a fourfold increase over the examined period, it seems that the Vietnamese academic community is adopting OA. Furthermore, Bayesian analysis results hint at positive associations of internal and external collaborative power (number of domestic and foreign authors, respectively) with the decision to publish in OA (βb_TotalVN_OpenAccess = 0.22; βb_TotalForeign_OpenAccess = 0.15).

The universal factors include the shift from academic science to ""postacademic"" one, which is oriented towards applied researches and commercial efficiency. Specific factors include the institutional instability which causes the weakening of the need in scientific results for the state and business; the transformations in science institute that cause the imitation of scientific activity and the decrease of conscientiousness of researchers; the ""blind"" copying of the Western concepts to analysis of Russian phenomena; the ""brain drain"".

Despite the central role played by strategic interactions in creating values in the Internet environment, our ability to understand them scientifically and to manage them in practice has remained limited. While engineering communities suffer from not hav- ing enough theoretical resource to formalize such phenom- ena, economics and social sciences lack adequate technology to properly operationalize their theoretical insights, thereby demanding an integrative solution. This project aims to develop a rational-choice-theory-driven framework for com- putational social science, focusing on social interactions on the Internet.

The field of agroecology is a prime example of transdisciplinarity. With roots in the biophysical sciences, social sciences, and peasant movements, publications in agroecology have been growing rapidly in recent decades. Here we explain a method—the script-expert adaptive classification (SEAC) method—that allows us to examine the engagements between agroecology and the social sciences by identifying publications within the agroecological literature that engage with social science at various levels. Using the term “agroecology” and its iterations, we gathered a corpus of agroecology literature up to and including 2019 with 12,398 unique publications from five publication databases—Scopus, Web of Science, Agricola, CAB Direct, and EconLit. Using the SEAC method we then classified each publication as engaged, partially engaged, and not engaged with social sciences and separated this Agroecology Corpus 2019 into three corpora: agroecology engaged with social sciences (with 3,125 publications), agroecology not engaged with social sciences (with 7,039 publications), and agroecology with uncertain engagement with social science (with 2,234 publications) or unclassifiable. This article explains the SEAC method in detail so other transdisciplinary scholars can replicate and/or adapt it for similar purposes. We also assess the SEAC method’s value in identifying social science publications relative to the classification systems of the major multidisciplinary bibliographic databases, Scopus, and Web of Science. We conclude by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the SEAC method and by pointing to further questions about agroecology and the social sciences to be asked of the corpora. © 2023 Pinzón et al.

One, more specific, approach is that of social simulation which addresses how behaviour of many actors can lead to emergent effects. We argue that this approach, while useful as a tool in social science policy development, is fundamentally constrained due to the fact that its models are developed within the society they are supposed to model. Alternatively, the second theme looks to take a more holistic view by taking inspiration from systems sociology. This approach looks to build societies from the bottom up and may allow us to generate new perspectives in social theory. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",Computer simulation; Social sciences; Systems science; Social science modeling; Social science policy; Artificial intelligence,Social Sciences

These sciences are being profoundly destabilised by a dual process of naturalisation of social phenomena and fetishisation of numbers, accentuated by the development of AI (part 1). Both STM (science, technology, medicine) and HSS are facing major epistemological challenges, but for the latter they carry the risk of marginalisation (part 2). The humanities and social sciences remain the best equipped to question the social construct represented by the development of AI. However, this essential approach is not enough. We need to ask ourselves: how can the HSS reintroduce interpretation when they have less and less control over how data is put together? Only a balanced partnership between STM and HSS is likely to meet all these challenges (part 3). Using the case of education, which has long been at the forefront of developments in other sectors of social life, we would like to show how and on what priority issues such a partnership can be built (part 4). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Dual process; Epistemological challenge; Humanities and social science; Humanity and social science; Interpreting phenomenon; Marginalization; Science technologies; Social life; Behavioral research,Social Sciences

However, the interrelationship between these different disciplinary domains, particularly the physical and social sciences, often occurs many years after a technology has matured and moved towards commercialization. Synthetic biology may serve an exception to this idea, where, since 2000, the physical and the social sciences communities have increasingly framed their research in response to various perspectives in biological engineering, risk assessment needs, governance challenges, and the social implications that the technology may incur. This paper reviews a broad collection of synthetic biology literature from 2000–2016, and demonstrates how the co-development of physical and social science communities has grown throughout synthetic biology’s earliest stages of development. Further, this paper indicates that future co-development of synthetic biology scholarship will assist with significant challenges of the technology’s risk assessment, governance, and public engagement needs, where an interdisciplinary approach is necessary to foster sustainable, risk-informed, and societally beneficial technological advances moving forward. ©, © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Results: Geospatial studies and social science share a very basic research objective which focuses on heterogeneity, and spatial big data provides an unprecedented paradigm for social studies. Also, challenges were raised on building a therotical framework, data availiablity, computing issues, and related concerns on ethics.

And how might the intellectual legacy of Chinese classical philosophy-for instance Sun Tzu and Lao Tzu-contribute to such a project? Reversing the more usual social science practice in which EuroAmerican concepts are applied in other global locations, this paper instead considers how a “Chinese” term, shi (shì, or “propensity”) might be used to explore the UK's 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic. Drawing on anthropological insights into mis/translation between different worlds and their alternative ways of knowing and being, the paper explores that epidemic in three differently inspired shi-inflected “empirical” accounts. The first uses Sun Tzu's strategic understanding of shi to tell a conventionally representational story. The second resists the causes and background factors implied in standard social science by offering a “light” and shi-inflected form of knowing. And the third combines the referentiality of social science with a Lao Tzu-informed commitment to the paradoxes of normative epigram. This third narrative thus illustrates the possible features of a situated and shi-inflected social science that recognizes that it participates in the contexted and immanent flows and counterflows of things in the world. The paper concludes by noting that such a shi-inflected social science is experimental, and suggests that it is important to explore a range of ways of reversing the flow of concepts between EuroAmerica and other global locations.

Several themes and found poems emerged in this reading: (1) how language oversimplifies complex social realities; (2) the voices of people living with HIV and AIDS must be included; (3) HIV and AIDS intersects with social inequalities; (4) social and structural issues are no barrier to HIV prevention and (5) the need for radical interdisciplinarity. The paper concludes that the end of AIDS requires responses that are integrated, holistic and that radically challenge our silo’d disciplinary boundaries and frames. The social sciences and humanities are key to this charge. © 2024 The Author(s).

Despite the strong position of Social Science in the Swedish school curricula, little research has been done in the field. Previous research has mainly concentrated on factual knowledge and conceptual learning, or the role of deliberation in class activities. Less research has focused on the role of disciplinary thinking and how that might promote learning to think like a social scientist while at the same time preparing students for citizenship. By using a conceptual framework from history didactics, Social Science education is in the following text explored in search of second order thinking concepts. Also, the relationship between these concepts and democratic socialisation is discussed. By focusing on one substantial case, this study tries to reach beyond the various topics commonly covered in Social Science education. The research was conducted by observing teaching in Social Science and interviewing six experienced teachers. Using this conceptual framework, ideas on how to organise, analyse, interpret and critically review discourses in society were constructed as six proposed second order thinking concepts of Social Science: social science causality, social science evidence and inference, social science abstraction, social science comparison and contrast, social science perspective taking and the evaluative dimension. The argument is that when students work scientifically they develop a way of thinking about society and they challenge their set opinions about different topics. Therefore, second order thinking concepts are important for learning Social Science and at the same time preparing students for a life as citizens. © 2015 JSSE",,Social Sciences

After presenting the thematic of social science concepts that figure as found object in cultural anthropology, this review briefly introduces the domain of history of social science (HSS). It then examines HSS studies that could enrich anthropological encounters with social science concepts, both methodologically and through the vivid social histories of relevant concepts, categories, and methods. I complement my review of these approaches in HSS with a discussion of anthropological studies of social science concepts. I review both the historical and the anthropological literature with the same key questions, focused on the analytical tools that each approach brings to the study of social science: what conditions of emergence of these social imaginaries are incorporated in the analyses, what contexts and processes relevant to their appropriation and travel are presented, and how these enquiries examine the effects on the worlds in which they circulate. In my conclusion, I point out how cultural anthropology can uniquely contribute to the domain of HSS.

The social sciences have been entangled with the EU integration process throughout the organization’s trajectory; still, social sciences have only lately been integrated into EU research policy in a marginal position. Drawing on Bourdieu’s generic field analysis, this article analyses the struggles over the position of the social sciences within EU research policies from the early 1990s until today. First, the analysis shows how the social sciences were included in EU research policies with the simultaneous establishment of the European field of social science through the formation of scientific associations, journals and European research infrastructures. Second, it focuses on the struggle over the position of the social sciences in Horizon 2020. This analysis shows how social-science researchers mobilized social and political capital in the efforts to organize and implement the H2020 to ensure the presence of social-science issues and researchers in the programme despite the dominance of other sciences and political issues. Overall, the analysis is a reminder of the generally subordinate position of the social sciences, particularly in EU research policies, but it also shows that well-organized social sciences can participate in organizing research funding and ensure representation of otherwise marginalized research fields. © The Author(s) 2021.",,Social Sciences

Objectives: To explore attitudes towards SUDs held by students in the social sciences, the future-to-be mental health professionals, as well as factors, which may affect these attitudes. Methods: Undergraduate and graduate students in the social sciences (psychology, social work, criminology; N = 184), were presented a vignette describing an individual with substance-related problems. Participants were randomly assigned with one of two vignettes, either addressing him as “suffering from substance use disorder” or as an “addict.” Attitudes were assessed by exploring the degree to which participants perceive the described individual as posing social threat and in need of treatment. Results: Women generally perceived individuals with SUDs as in more need for treatment compared to men. Men, but not women, were significantly affected by the terminology used, with less negative attitudes reported when using medical terminology. Conclusion: Gender differences in attitudes towards individuals with SUDs may be present in earlier stages of mental health professionals' career.

There are two strands to our argument as to why this is a useful site to explore methodological innovation in the social sciences. First, researching the body in digital environments places new methodological demands on social science. Second, as an area of interest at the intersection of the social sciences and the arts, it provides a focus for exploring how social science innovation can be informed by engagement with the arts, in this instance how the arts work with the body in digital environments and take up social science ideas in novel ways. We argue that social science engagement with the arts and the relatively unmapped terrain of the body in digital environments has the potential to open up spaces for innovative social science questions and methods: spaces, questions and methods that have potential for more general social science methodological innovation. We draw on the findings of the Methodological Innovation in Digital Arts and Social Sciences (MIDAS) project a multi-site ethnography of the research ecologies of the social sciences and the arts related to the body in digital environments. We propose a continuum of methodological innovation that attends to how methods are moved across research contexts and disciplines, in this instance the social sciences and the digital arts. We illustrate and discuss the innovative potential of expanding and re-situating methods across the social sciences and the arts, the transfer of methods and concepts across disciplinary borders and the interdisciplinary generation of new methods. We discuss the catalysts and challenges for social science methodological innovation in relation to the digital and the arts, with attention to how the social sciences might engage with the arts towards innovative research. © 2016 The Author(s).

This large-scale, long-term experiment of in silico social science, about which the ground truth of simulated worlds was known, but not by us, reveals the limits of contemporary quantitative social science methodology. First, problem solving without a shared ontology—in which many world characteristics remain existentially uncertain—poses strong limits to quantitative analysis even when scientists share a common task, and suggests how they could become insurmountable without it. Second, data labels biased the associations our analysts made and assumptions they employed, often away from the simulated causal processes those labels signified, suggesting limits on the degree to which analytic concepts developed in one domain may port to others. Third, the current standard for computational social science publication is a demonstration of novel causes, but this limits the relevance of models to solve problems and propose policies that benefit from the simpler and less surprising answers associated with most important causes, or the combination of all causes. Fourth, most singular quantitative methods applied on their own did not help to solve most analytical challenges, and we explored a range of established and emerging methods, including probabilistic programming, deep neural networks, systems of predictive probabilistic finite state machines, and more to achieve plausible solutions. However, despite these limitations common to the current practice of computational social science, we find on the positive side that even imperfect knowledge can be sufficient to identify robust prediction if a more pluralistic approach is applied. Applying competing approaches by distinct subteams, including at one point the vast TopCoder.com global community of problem solvers, enabled discovery of many aspects of the relevant structure underlying worlds that singular methods could not. Together, these lessons suggest how different a policy-oriented computational social science would be than the computational social science we have inherited. Computational social science that serves policy would need to endure more failure, sustain more diversity, maintain more uncertainty, and allow for more complexity than current institutions support. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Big data; Deep neural networks; 'current; Computational social science; Deep learning; Ground truth; In-silico; Large-scales; Machine-learning; Quantitative social science; Simulated society; Simulation; Behavioral research,Social Sciences

In order to unpack the social and political determinants of NTDs, it is important to view the problem from a social science perspective.

Our working hypothesis is that a linear (cumulative) understanding of progress in the humanities and social sciences expresses itself in a tendency towards methodological reductionism (naturalization within epistemology of social sciences and humanities), which, in turn, is opposed to a non-linear (pluralistic) approach that proclaims a theoretical variety and pluralism of methodological attitudes. This trend is determined by the desire to strengthen the epistemic foundations of social sciences and humanities through the reception of concepts and approaches of other, “more successful” natural sciences or mathematical approaches from related fields in social sciences. Depending on how exactly the reception takes place and with which disciplines ties are built up, we distinguish three strategies for the development of naturalization. The first is a substitution strategy in which the social sciences and humanities not only borrow directly from natural sciences approaches, but also abandon their own specific research subject. The second strategy is an adaptation strategy. In this case, we are not talking about methodological substitution in its pure form, but about the possibility of partial reception of certain natural science theories and methods (or the reception of mathematical methods from related areas of social knowledge – for example, from the area of economic analysis) in accordance with the goals and objectives of social and humanitarian research (that is, the social sciences and humanities retain their specific subject of research, and the methodological base expands through the use of scientific and mathematical methods and data). And finally, the third is the validation strategy, in which the specific subject of social and humanitarian research is preserved. However, the borrowing of scientific methods occurs not at the stage of the research, but at the stage of assessing its results. In the paper we use specific examples from the social sciences and humanities to consider three strategies of reductionism (as naturalization) from the point of view of their consequences for the development of social sciences and humanities in an internalist perspective. © 2022, Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences.

Collaboration with environmental health science through team projects has advanced and improved our understanding of environmental health and justice. Objective: We sought to identify diverse methods and topics in which social scientists have expanded environmental health understandings at multiple levels, to examine how transdisciplinary environmental health research fosters better science, and to learn how these partnerships have been able to flourish because of the support from National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). Methods: We analyzed various types of social science research to investigate how social science contributes to environmental health. We also examined NIEHS programs that foster social science. In addition, we developed a case study of a community-based participation research project in Akwesasne in order to demonstrate how social science has enhanced environmental health science. Results: Social science has informed environmental health science through ethnographic studies of contaminated communities, analysis of spatial distribution of environmental injustice, psychological experience of contamination, social construction of risk and risk perception, and social impacts of disasters. Social science-environmental health team science has altered the way scientists traditionally explore exposure by pressing for cumulative exposure approaches and providing research data for policy applications. conclusions: A transdisciplinary approach for environmental health practice has emerged that engages the social sciences to paint a full picture of the consequences of contamination so that policy makers, regulators, public health officials, and other stakeholders can better ameliorate impacts and prevent future exposure. © 2015, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Modern mathematics, and especially the mathematics of algorithms and statistics, get their objectivity from the intersubjective validity of formal proof. Algorithms implementing statistical inference, or scientific algorithms, are what distinguishes computational social science epistemically from other social sciences. This gives computational social science an objective validity that other social sciences do not have. Objections to the scientific realism of this philosophy from the positions of anti-instrumentalism, postmodern interpretivism, and situated epistemology are considered and either incorporated into this philosophy of computational social science or refuted.

SISS systems use geographic location as the basis for integrating heterogeneous social science data sets and for visualizing and analyzing the integrated results through mapping interfaces. However, sourcing data sets, aggregating data captured at different spatial scales, and implementing statistical analysis techniques over the data are highly complex and challenging steps, beyond the capabilities of many social scientists. The aim of the UQ SISS eResearch Facility (SISS-eRF) is to remove this burden from social scientists by providing a Web interface that allows researchers to quickly access relevant Australian socio-spatial datasets (e.g. census data, voting data), aggregate them spatially, conduct statistical modeling on the datasets and visualize spatial distribution patterns and statistical results. This paper describes the technical architecture and components of SISS-eRF and discusses the reasons that underpin the technological choices. It describes some case studies that demonstrate how SISS-eRF is being applied to prove hypotheses that relate particular voting patterns with socio-economic parameters (e.g., gender, age, housing, income, education, employment, religion/culture). Finally we outline our future plans for extending and deploying SISS-eRF across the Australian Social Science Community. ©2012 IEEE.",Behavioral research; Data integration; Population statistics; Statistical methods; Census data; E-research; Geo-spatial information systems; Geographic location; Science community; Social science data; Social scientists; Socio-economics; Spatial distribution patterns; Spatial scale; Statistical modeling; Technical architecture; Web interface; Social sciences,Social Sciences

The authors conducted a systematic review to evaluate the published literature from 1980 to 2001 on behavioral and social science theory applications to unintentional injury prevention and control. Electronic database searches in PubMed and PsycINFO identified articles that combined behavioral and social sciences theories and models and injury causes. The authors identified some articles that examined behavioral and social science theories and models and unintentional injury topics, but found that several important theories have never been applied to unintentional injury prevention. Among the articles identified, the PRECEDE PROCEED Model was cited most frequently, followed by the Theory of Reasoned Action/Theory of Planned Behavior and Health Belief Model. When behavioral and social sciences theories and models were applied to unintentional injury topics, they were most frequently used to guide program design, implementation or develop evaluation measures; few examples of theory testing were found. Results suggest that the use of behavioral and social sciences theories and models in unintentional injury prevention research is only marginally represented in the mainstream, peer-reviewed literature.

The role of values in social science is explored and it is argued that a more appropriate balance needs to be struck with the political underpinnings of the research enterprise. The importance of applying relevant research in the social sciences is underlined and the factors which inhibit and encourage this are considered.

It argues that the question of whether nursing was an art, science and/or social science has been at die ‘heart’ of a wider debate on die occupational status and disciplinary identity of nursing. The view that nursing was essentially an art and a ‘calling’, was championed by Florence Nightingale. Ethel Bedford Fenwick and her allies insisted that nursing, like other professions, was a ‘scientific’ and technical enterprise. Social scientists later came to challenge nursing's claim to professionalism by analysing nursing work first within die context of industrial psychology. But they also advocated a rapprochement between nursing, health services and social science research, a challenge which we are in nursing, still striving to meet This paper argues for a strong coalition of nursing with its former nineteenth century ally, social science, in die continuing struggle for change within nursing and health care policy. Rather than searching for some rarified and purified essence of nursing knowledge, it argues that nurses need to join forces with sociologists and economists in striving to shape die agenda for health services research and provide die evidential basis for health policy transformation more generally.

Study Design and Setting: Commentary. Results: Contributions of social science to the health sciences are not always recognized as such. It may help if the professional profile of social science in the health sciences would be higher and if its focus would be more on making useful predictions.

That is why neutrosophic theory is suitable for representing and modeling the data from studies on any social sciences.

To teach Sachunterricht in a high-quality manner, it is reasonable to assume that primary school teachers themselves require— among other things, such as knowledge about pedagogy, teaching Sachunterricht, and the various content areas of Sachunterricht—a distinct interest, academic self-concept, and sense of belonging regarding natural and social sciences. Furthermore, they should possess a solid interdisciplinary competence that enables them to teach natural and social sciences in an integrative way. In the present study, we conducted a longitudinal survey of pre-service primary school teachers from a German university over a period of 2 years to investigate the changes in their (self-evaluated) interdisciplinary competence; the changes in their interest, academic self-concept, and sense of belonging regarding natural and social sciences; and the correlations between these constructs. Our data analysis revealed a decrease over time in participants’ sense of belonging to natural and social sciences, as well as their (self-evaluated) interdisciplinary competence, while their academic self-concept in natural and social sciences remained stable. Participants’ interest in social sciences decreased, while their interest in natural sciences increased. Moreover, we found varying degrees of correlation between these constructs. In summary, the results of the present study provide important insights into the professional development of pre-service primary school teachers within university-based teacher education for teaching natural and social sciences in primary school. The implications of these findings are discussed in detail at the end of this paper. © 2023 Published by KURA Education & Publishing.",,Social Sciences

For this study we conducted focus groups at three research laboratories within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development to better understand how inclusion of social sciences influenced the research process and outcomes, and the barriers to and facilitators of integration. The focus groups identified effects on the research process including improved problem framing, the introduction of new methodologies, and greater stakeholder and public inclusion, while research outcomes included the inclusion or refinement of social and environmental perspectives and systems thinking, increased translatability of research, and new partnerships. Barriers identified included lack of familiarity with social sciences which affected perceptions of social sciences and organizational capacity to absorb and apply social science expertise. Facilitators included receptivity of team members, intentional communication strategies, and project structures and organizational commitment that support interdisciplinary work. Finding a key barrier to be lack of clarity about the different roles social sciences play in translational research, we present a conceptual model defining the roles and contributions of social scientists that clarifies the distinction between “integration” of social sciences in research and “application” of skills and knowledge from the social sciences which play distinct but equally important roles in translational research approaches and solutions-driven research. These insights on the ways social sciences contribute to translational research efforts advance integration of social and natural sciences in environmental science research, particularly in applied contexts. © 2021",article; conceptual model; environmental protection; environmental science; human; human experiment; interdisciplinary research; outcome assessment; perception; skill; sociology; translational research,Social Sciences

With both basic and applied approaches, behavioral and social sciences are relevant to every discipline in dentistry and all dental, oral, and craniofacial sciences, as well as oral health promotion programs and health care delivery. Key to understanding multilevel, interacting influences on oral health behavior and outcomes, the behavioral and social sciences focus on individuals, families, groups, cultures, systems, societies, regions, and nations. Uniquely positioned to highlight the importance of racial, cultural, and other equity in oral health, the behavioral and social sciences necessitate a focus on both individuals and groups, societal reactions to them related to power, and environmental and other contextual factors. Presented here is a consensus statement that was produced through an iterative feedback process. The statement reflects the current state of knowledge in the behavioral and social oral health sciences and identifies future directions for the field, focusing on 4 key areas: behavioral and social theories and mechanisms related to oral health, use of multiple and novel methodologies in social and behavioral research and practice related to oral health, development and testing of behavioral and social interventions to promote oral health, and dissemination and implementation research for oral health. This statement was endorsed by over 400 individuals and groups from around the world and representing numerous disciplines in oral health and the behavioral and social sciences. Having reached consensus, action is needed to advance and further integrate and translate behavioral and social sciences into oral health research, oral health promotion and health care, and the training of those working to ensure oral health for all. © International Association for Dental Research and American Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research 2022.",Delivery of Health Care; Forecasting; Health Promotion; Humans; Oral Health; Social Sciences; forecasting; health; health care delivery; health promotion; human; sociology,Social Sciences

However, in practice most social scientists in South Korea tend to explain their social issues and problems through mainstream theoretical perspectives that were primarily developed in the West. This study investigates how much social science research is localized in four selected social science disciplines (sociology, political science, public administration, and education) in South Korea. The study analyzes articles published in one representative domestic journal in each discipline to assess the localization of knowledge production during the last three decades (1988–2017). It was found that the local knowledge-base of Korean social science research is relatively weak though it has been continuously increasing during the last three decades. It was also found that knowledge production in social sciences is reliant on Western theory even though the research topics are locally embedded. In addition, the findings revealed that there are noticeable differences between the applied fields (public administration and education) and the pure fields (sociology and political science). Applied fields of public administration and education are more locally embedded than pure fields of sociology and political science. This study proposes that social science research in South Korea should draw more on indigenous knowledge and be less reliant on Western theory in the future. © The Author(s) 2021.",,Social Sciences

Firstly, I will identify the two obstacles that challenge the relevance of pss in social science. On the one hand, I will take the case of social science in Mexico and point out a pitfall present there around their understanding of the central claim of the philosophy of science; then I will try to offer a solution to this misunderstanding. I discuss how philosophical claims better sum up the conditions to support epistemological assumptions in social science research. On the other hand, I will suggest that a second obstacle to recognizing the relevance of pss is the self-sufficiency stance of social science concerning its epistemological assumptions. Finally, I will show three examples of pss contributions to crucial debates in contemporary social science, namely, social causality, the role of interpretation, and scientific objectivity. © 2019 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

Design/methodology/approach - A historical analysis, leading to an outline of advanced logic of social science research, shows the way to modern (computer) simulation research. Findings - When the theoretical principles of sociocybernetics are put into practice by doing (empirically based) simulation research, it can handle in a scientifically valid way a number of research questions modern complex society poses, such as how processes of self-organization in individuals, groups and institutes can be described and understood; self-organization of autobiographic memory of individuals can be simulated in a computer; these individual memories are related to collective memories of generations; these different generations of social researchers can work together and balance in a creative synergy between the wisdom of the past and surprising hypotheses of the future. Research limitations/implications - Social sciences researchers have to work with advanced logic of research such as is propagated in simulation research and by sociocybernetics. Practical implications - Different generations of sociocyberneticians here to work together in (empirically based) simulation research to demonstrate the usefulness of sociocybernetical theory and logic.

This reconfiguration will require a broad and empowered role for social scientists. Yet RI has been preoccupied with public and stakeholder inclusion, rather than social science inclusion. We probe this gap through a case study of the social sciences in the development of gene drive mosquitoes for malaria control in Mali and Uganda. Our data reveals potential diverse roles and future research agendas for the social sciences. We outline some challenges facing the social sciences in this space and ways to promote and support them. Lastly, we argue that RI’s predilection for reflexive and critical social science obscures a richer repertoire of social science roles that are an imperative and fundamental part of efforts to address global challenges in the Global South. © 2023 The Author(s).

It took the 1964 Alaska earthquake to draw the attention of U.S. social scientists to earthquake research, even though systematic studies of other extreme events such as floods, hurricanes, and tornados had been conducted by them starting in the 1940s and 1950s. This changed significantly after the Alaska earthquake struck the 49th state. Part of the explanation for this was the conjunction of the earthquake and the creation of the Disaster Research Center at the Ohio State University in 1963, just ahead of the Alaska earthquake, becoming the first social science research center in the world engaged in disaster studies. The social science research output, along with the even more extensive earth science and earthquake engineering research, made the Alaska earthquake the most documented U.S. earthquake in history. Like the research in the other disciplines, the social science research conducted after the Alaska earthquake had important consequences. It extended the body of knowledge in the field. It also helped set the stage for important policy and programmatic changes in the earthquake community, including the creation of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program and increased multidisciplinary disaster research and international collaboration.",Behavioral research; Disasters; Earth sciences; Engineering geology; International cooperation; Social sciences; Alaska earthquakes; Earthquake engineering; Earthquake hazard; Earthquake research; International collaborations; Ohio State University; Programmatic changes; Social science research; Earthquakes,Social Sciences

This security infrastructure presents two main features. Firstly, Guanxi Shibboleth is integrated into the user-friendly Sakai collaborative and learning environment which provides an ideal place for users to access a variety of federation resources in line with the Shibboleth authentication model. Secondly, PERMIS technology is used to enhance the authorization mechanisms thus enabling a policy-driven, role-based, fine-grained access control. As a result, the security infrastructure presents the advantages of Guanxi Shibboleth, PERMIS and Sakai, and it has been applied to e-Social Science application. We believe this security infrastructure provides a promising authentication and authorization solution for e-social science applications as well as applications in other domains.",Authentication; Computer science; Distributed computer systems; Network architecture; Technical presentations; Authentication and authorization; Authentication models; e-Social science; In-line; Learning environments; Open source implementation; Policy driven; Role-based; Security infrastructure; Security requirements; Social sciences,Social Sciences
